Dialogue: 0,0:02:53.05,0:02:55.31,EN,,0,0,0,,give you a real concrete feeling for this sort of thing.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:55.44,0:02:57.66,EN,,0,0,0,,Let's start with a very simple program.

Dialogue: 0,0:03:26.20,0:03:28.91,EN,,0,0,0,,And the algorithm is extremely simple.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:29.50,0:03:31.08,EN,,0,0,0,,If B is 0,
Dialogue: 0,0:03:34.16,0:03:36.83,EN,,0,0,0,,then the result is going to be A.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:37.52,0:03:43.61,EN,,0,0,0,,Otherwise, the result is the GCD of B
Dialogue: 0,0:03:44.49,0:03:53.39,EN,,0,0,0,,and the remainder when A is divided by B.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:58.53,0:04:01.90,EN,,0,0,0,,So this we have here is a very simple iterative process.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:02.03,0:04:04.08,EN,,0,0,0,,This a simple recursive procedure,

Dialogue: 0,0:04:09.95,0:04:12.46,EN,,0,0,0,,And the way it works is that every step,
Dialogue: 0,0:04:12.80,0:04:15.10,EN,,0,0,0,,it determines whether B was zero.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:16.24,0:04:18.80,EN,,0,0,0,,And if B is 0, we got the answer in A.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:19.63,0:04:22.46,EN,,0,0,0,,Otherwise, we make another step

Dialogue: 0,0:04:28.76,0:04:29.55,EN,,0,0,0,,Very simple.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:31.11,0:04:32.72,EN,,0,0,0,,Now this, I've already told you

Dialogue: 0,0:04:41.18,0:04:43.69,EN,,0,0,0,,is that one of the reasons why this is iterative
Dialogue: 0,0:04:43.95,0:04:47.68,EN,,0,0,0,,is nothing is needed of the last step to get the answer.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:49.44,0:04:55.29,EN,,0,0,0,,All of the information that's needed to run this algorithm is in A and B.

Dialogue: 0,1:08:33.76,1:08:35.32,EN,,0,0,0,,is the guy who restores it, because he needs it.
Dialogue: 0,1:08:36.93,1:08:38.54,EN,,0,0,0,,And in such discipline,
Dialogue: 0,1:08:38.86,1:08:40.76,EN,,0,0,0,,you can see what things are unnecessary,
Dialogue: 0,1:08:43.45,1:08:44.73,EN,,0,0,0,,operations that are unimportant.
Dialogue: 0,1:08:47.15,1:08:50.40,EN,,0,0,0,,Now, one other thing I want to tell you about is very simple
Dialogue: 0,1:08:51.66,1:08:54.67,EN,,0,0,0,,is that, of course, the picture you see is not the whole picture.
Dialogue: 0,1:08:55.35,1:08:56.68,EN,,0,0,0,,Supposing I had systems
Dialogue: 0,1:08:56.80,1:09:01.52,EN,,0,0,0,,had things like other operations, CAR, CDR, CONS,
Dialogue: 0,1:09:03.53,1:09:05.60,EN,,0,0,0,,building a vector
Dialogue: 0,1:09:05.88,1:09:07.32,EN,,0,0,0,,and referencing the nth element of it,
Dialogue: 0,1:09:08.30,1:09:09.21,EN,,0,0,0,,or things like that.
Dialogue: 0,1:09:10.40,1:09:13.60,EN,,0,0,0,,Well, at this level of detail, whatever it is,
Dialogue: 0,1:09:13.87,1:09:17.85,EN,,0,0,0,,we can conceptualize those as primitive operations in the datapath.
Dialogue: 0,1:09:18.75,1:09:21.95,EN,,0,0,0,,In other words, we could say that some machine that, for example, has
Dialogue: 0,1:09:22.32,1:09:24.11,EN,,0,0,0,,has the append machine,
Dialogue: 0,1:09:24.20,1:09:26.46,EN,,0,0,0,,which has to do cons of the CAR of x
Dialogue: 0,1:09:26.64,1:09:29.80,EN,,0,0,0,,with the append of the CDR of x and y,
Dialogue: 0,1:09:29.88,1:09:33.18,EN,,0,0,0,,well, gee, that's exactly the same as the factorial structure.
Dialogue: 0,1:09:33.63,1:09:35.29,EN,,0,0,0,,Well, it's got about the same structure.
Dialogue: 0,1:09:36.54,1:09:37.27,EN,,0,0,0,,And what do we have?
Dialogue: 0,1:09:37.27,1:09:39.39,EN,,0,0,0,,We have some sort of things in it
Dialogue: 0,1:09:39.76,1:09:42.48,EN,,0,0,0,,which may be registers, x and y,
Dialogue: 0,1:09:42.51,1:09:45.12,EN,,0,0,0,,and then x has to somehow move to y sometimes,
Dialogue: 0,1:09:45.28,1:09:46.75,EN,,0,0,0,,x has to get the value of y.
Dialogue: 0,1:09:46.93,1:09:50.11,EN,,0,0,0,,And then we may have to be able to do something which is a cons.
Dialogue: 0,1:09:51.70,1:09:57.74,EN,,0,0,0,,I don't remember if I need to like this is in this system,
Dialogue: 0,1:09:57.76,1:10:01.10,EN,,0,0,0,,but cons is sort of like subtract or add or something.
Dialogue: 0,1:10:01.42,1:10:02.70,EN,,0,0,0,,It combines two things,
Dialogue: 0,1:10:02.73,1:10:04.27,EN,,0,0,0,,producing a thing which is the cons,
Dialogue: 0,1:10:04.51,1:10:06.49,EN,,0,0,0,,which we may then think goes into there.
Dialogue: 0,1:10:07.60,1:10:09.72,EN,,0,0,0,,And then maybe a thing called the CAR,
Dialogue: 0,1:10:12.88,1:10:16.22,EN,,0,0,0,,which will produce-- I can get the CAR or something.
Dialogue: 0,1:10:16.92,1:10:19.55,EN,,0,0,0,,And maybe I can get the CDR of something, and so on.
Dialogue: 0,1:10:20.15,1:10:22.30,EN,,0,0,0,,But we shouldn't be too afraid of saying things this way,
Dialogue: 0,1:10:22.92,1:10:24.24,EN,,0,0,0,,because the worst that could happen
Dialogue: 0,1:10:24.94,1:10:26.41,EN,,0,0,0,,is if we open up cons,
Dialogue: 0,1:10:27.31,1:10:29.82,EN,,0,0,0,,what we're going to find is some machine.
Dialogue: 0,1:10:31.88,1:10:34.44,EN,,0,0,0,,And cons may in fact overlap with CAR and CDR, and it always does,
Dialogue: 0,1:10:35.50,1:10:38.12,EN,,0,0,0,,in the same way that plus and minus overlap,
Dialogue: 0,1:10:38.57,1:10:39.85,EN,,0,0,0,,and really the same business.
Dialogue: 0,1:10:41.21,1:10:42.60,EN,,0,0,0,,CONS, CAR, and CDR are going to overlap,
Dialogue: 0,1:10:42.62,1:10:44.52,EN,,0,0,0,,and we're going to find a little controller,
Dialogue: 0,1:10:45.50,1:10:46.54,EN,,0,0,0,,a little datapath,
Dialogue: 0,1:10:48.03,1:10:49.64,EN,,0,0,0,,which may have some registers in it,
Dialogue: 0,1:10:50.00,1:10:52.86,EN,,0,0,0,,some stuff like that.
Dialogue: 0,1:10:53.30,1:10:54.41,EN,,0,0,0,,And maybe inside it,
Dialogue: 0,1:10:54.43,1:10:56.16,EN,,0,0,0,,there may also be an infinite part,
Dialogue: 0,1:10:56.46,1:10:58.70,EN,,0,0,0,,a part that's semi-infinite or something,
Dialogue: 0,1:10:58.81,1:11:00.65,EN,,0,0,0,,which is a lot of very uniform stuff,
Dialogue: 0,1:11:00.96,1:11:02.03,EN,,0,0,0,,which we'll call memory.
Dialogue: 0,1:11:06.57,1:11:08.83,EN,,0,0,0,,And I wouldn't be so horrified if that were the way it works.
Dialogue: 0,1:11:09.33,1:11:11.07,EN,,0,0,0,,In fact, it does, and we'll talk about that later.
Dialogue: 0,1:11:13.32,1:11:14.57,EN,,0,0,0,,So are there any questions?
Dialogue: 0,1:11:24.34,1:11:25.80,EN,,0,0,0,,Gee, what an unquestioning audience.
Dialogue: 0,1:11:28.67,1:11:30.33,EN,,0,0,0,,Suppose I tell you a horrible pile of lies.
Dialogue: 0,1:11:39.69,1:11:40.38,EN,,0,0,0,,OK.
Dialogue: 0,1:11:41.99,1:11:42.52,EN,,0,0,0,,Well, thank you.
