[MUSIC PLAYING]

2
00:00:16,401 --> 00:00:19,520
PROFESSOR: Well, let's see.

3
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:21,800
What we did so far was
a lot of fun, was

4
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:23,050
it useful for anything?

5
00:00:23,050 --> 00:00:26,330


6
00:00:26,330 --> 00:00:29,380
I suppose the answer
is going to be yes.

7
00:00:29,380 --> 00:00:33,930
If these metacircular
interpreters are a valuable

8
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:35,180
thing to play with.

9
00:00:35,180 --> 00:00:38,050


10
00:00:38,050 --> 00:00:41,300
Well, there have been times I
spend 50% of my time, over a

11
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:46,590
year, trying various design
alternatives by experimenting

12
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:49,600
with them with metacircular
interpreters--

13
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:52,570
metacircular interpreters like
the sort you just saw.

14
00:00:52,570 --> 00:00:55,910
Metacircular is because they
are defined in terms of

15
00:00:55,910 --> 00:00:58,830
themselves in such a way that
the language they interpret

16
00:00:58,830 --> 00:01:01,270
contains itself.

17
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:04,080
Such interpreters are a
convenient medium for

18
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:06,800
exploring language issues.

19
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:11,010
If you want to try adding a new
feature, it's sort of a

20
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:15,490
snap, it's easy, you just do
it and see what happens.

21
00:01:15,490 --> 00:01:17,710
You play with that language for
a while you say, gee, I'm

22
00:01:17,710 --> 00:01:21,090
didn't like that, you
throw it away.

23
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:24,640
Or you might want to see what
the difference is if you'd

24
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:30,080
make a slight difference in the
binding strategy, or some

25
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:33,720
more complicated things
that might occur.

26
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:36,810
In fact, these metacircular
interpreters are an excellent

27
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:44,030
medium for people exchanging
ideas about language design,

28
00:01:44,030 --> 00:01:46,960
because they're pretty easy to
understand, and they're short,

29
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:49,690
and compact, and simple.

30
00:01:49,690 --> 00:01:54,360
If I have some idea that I want
somebody to criticize

31
00:01:54,360 --> 00:02:00,770
like say, Dan Friedman at
Indiana, I'd write a little

32
00:02:00,770 --> 00:02:04,260
metacircular interpreter and
send him some network mail

33
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:05,450
with this interpreter in it.

34
00:02:05,450 --> 00:02:07,900
He could whip it up on his
machine and play with it and

35
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:11,940
say, that's no good.

36
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:13,706
And then send it back to me and
say, well, why don't you

37
00:02:13,706 --> 00:02:16,880
try this one, it's
a little better.

38
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:20,160
So I want to show you some
of that technology.

39
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:24,750
See, because, really, it's the
essential, simple technology

40
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:27,760
for getting started in designing
your own languages

41
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:30,790
for particular purposes.

42
00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:34,210
Let's start by adding a very
simple feature to a Lisp.

43
00:02:34,210 --> 00:02:40,640


44
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:42,800
Now, one thing I want
to tell you about is

45
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,370
features, before I start.

46
00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:49,560


47
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:53,100
There are many languages that
have made a mess of themselves

48
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:56,620
by adding huge numbers
of features.

49
00:02:56,620 --> 00:03:00,620
Computer scientists have a joke
about bugs that transform

50
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:02,520
it to features all the time.

51
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:05,030


52
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:10,120
But I like to think of it is
that many systems suffer from

53
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:12,820
what's called creeping
featurism.

54
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:17,740
Which is that George has a pet
feature he'd like in the

55
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:20,170
system, so he adds it.

56
00:03:20,170 --> 00:03:23,480
And then Harry says, gee, this
system is no longer what

57
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:26,640
exactly I like, so I'm going
to add my favorite feature.

58
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:30,710
And then Jim adds his
favorite feature.

59
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:35,280
And, after a while, the thing
has a manual 500 pages long

60
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,790
that no one can understand.

61
00:03:37,790 --> 00:03:40,780
And sometimes it's the same
person who writes all of these

62
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:44,830
features and produces this
terribly complicated thing.

63
00:03:44,830 --> 00:03:48,250
In some cases, like editors,
it's sort of reasonable to

64
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:51,940
have lots of features, because
there are a lot of things you

65
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:55,730
want to be able to do and
many of them arbitrary.

66
00:03:55,730 --> 00:04:00,440
But in computer languages, I
think it's a disaster to have

67
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:01,690
too much stuff in them.

68
00:04:01,690 --> 00:04:04,110


69
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:06,860
The other alternative you get
into is something called

70
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:12,300
feeping creaturism, which is
where you have a box which has

71
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:17,370
a display, a fancy display, and
a mouse, and there is all

72
00:04:17,370 --> 00:04:21,010
sorts of complexity associated
with all this fancy IO.

73
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:24,430
And your computer language
becomes a dismal, little, tiny

74
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:26,430
thing that barely works because
of all the swapping,

75
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:30,080
and disk twitching, and so on,
caused by your Windows system.

76
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:32,650
And every time you go near the
computer, the mouse process

77
00:04:32,650 --> 00:04:35,910
wakes up and says, gee do you
have something for me to do,

78
00:04:35,910 --> 00:04:37,440
and then it goes
back to sleep.

79
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:40,210
And if you accidentally push
mouse with you elbow, a big

80
00:04:40,210 --> 00:04:41,600
puff of smoke comes out
of your computer

81
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:42,940
and things like that.

82
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:46,030
So two ways to disastrously
destroy a

83
00:04:46,030 --> 00:04:47,500
system by adding features.

84
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:49,730
But try right now to add a
little, simple feature.

85
00:04:49,730 --> 00:04:52,300


86
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:54,350
This actually is a good
one, and in fact,

87
00:04:54,350 --> 00:04:57,250
real Lisps have it.

88
00:04:57,250 --> 00:05:03,420
As you've seen, there are
procedures like plus and times

89
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:05,430
that take any number
of arguments.

90
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:09,440
So we can write things like the
sum of the product of a

91
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:17,540
and x and x, and the product
of b and x and c.

92
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:21,210
As you can see here, addition
takes three arguments or two

93
00:05:21,210 --> 00:05:24,230
arguments, multiplication takes
two arguments or three

94
00:05:24,230 --> 00:05:27,290
arguments, taking numbers of
arguments all of which are to

95
00:05:27,290 --> 00:05:30,000
be treated in the same way.

96
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,300
This is a valuable thing,

97
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:34,960
indefinite numbers of arguments.

98
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:40,460
Yet the particular Lisp system
that I showed you is one where

99
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:43,600
the numbers of arguments is
fixed, because I had to match

100
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,910
the arguments against the
formal parameters in the

101
00:05:45,910 --> 00:05:47,850
binder, where there's
a pairup.

102
00:05:47,850 --> 00:05:50,810


103
00:05:50,810 --> 00:05:53,460
Well, I'd like to be able to
define new procedures like

104
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:58,590
this that can have any
number of arguments.

105
00:05:58,590 --> 00:06:01,150
Well there's several parts
to this problem.

106
00:06:01,150 --> 00:06:03,870
The first part is coming
up with the syntactic

107
00:06:03,870 --> 00:06:10,620
specification, some way of
notating the additional

108
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:15,480
arguments, of which you don't
know how many there are.

109
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:17,980
And then there's the other
thing, which is once we've

110
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:21,940
notated it, how are we going to
interpret that notation so

111
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:26,980
as to do the right thing,
whatever the right thing is?

112
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:29,230
So let's consider an example
of a sort of thing we might

113
00:06:29,230 --> 00:06:30,480
want to be able to do.

114
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:33,070


115
00:06:33,070 --> 00:06:36,380
So an example might be, that
I might want to be able to

116
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:40,490
define a procedure which is a
procedure of one required

117
00:06:40,490 --> 00:06:45,820
argument x and a bunch of
arguments, I don't know how

118
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:49,090
many there are, called y.

119
00:06:49,090 --> 00:07:00,725
So x is required, and there are
many y's, many argument--

120
00:07:00,725 --> 00:07:04,710


121
00:07:04,710 --> 00:07:05,990
y will be the list of them.

122
00:07:05,990 --> 00:07:14,480


123
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:17,370
Now, with such a thing, we might
be able to say something

124
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:20,720
like, map--

125
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,590
I'm going to do something
to every one--

126
00:07:22,590 --> 00:07:30,055
of that procedure of one
argument u, which multiplies x

127
00:07:30,055 --> 00:07:36,890
by u, and we'll apply
that to y.

128
00:07:36,890 --> 00:07:41,020
I've used a dot here to indicate
that the thing after

129
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:46,300
this is a list of all the
rest of the arguments.

130
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:47,745
I'm making a syntactic
specification.

131
00:07:47,745 --> 00:07:53,320


132
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:56,870
Now, what this depends upon, the
reason why this is sort of

133
00:07:56,870 --> 00:08:01,440
a reasonable thing to do, is
because this happens to be a

134
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:04,640
syntax that's used in
the Lisp reader for

135
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:08,631
representing conses.

136
00:08:08,631 --> 00:08:11,080
We've never introduced
that before.

137
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:13,680
You may have seen when playing
with the system that if you

138
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:16,740
cons two things together, you
get the first, space, dot, the

139
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:19,800
second, space--

140
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:23,880
the first, space, dot, space,
the second with parentheses

141
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:26,980
around the whole thing.

142
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:36,350
So that, for example, this x dot
y corresponds to a pair,

143
00:08:36,350 --> 00:08:41,870
which has got an x in
it and a y in it.

144
00:08:41,870 --> 00:08:45,520
The other notations that you've
seen so far are things

145
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:55,720
like a procedure of arguments x
and y and z which do things,

146
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:57,590
and that looks like--

147
00:08:57,590 --> 00:09:02,000


148
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,910
Just looking at the bound
variable list, it looks like

149
00:09:04,910 --> 00:09:18,280
this, x, y, z, and
the empty thing.

150
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:22,590
If I have a list of arguments I
wish to match this against,

151
00:09:22,590 --> 00:09:26,110
supposing, I have a list of
arguments one, two, three, I

152
00:09:26,110 --> 00:09:36,300
want to match these against. So
I might have here a list of

153
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:46,380
three things, one, two, three.

154
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:48,990


155
00:09:48,990 --> 00:09:54,220
And I want to match x, y, z
against one, two, three.

156
00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:56,830
Well, it's clear that the one
matches the x, because I can

157
00:09:56,830 --> 00:10:00,130
just sort of follow the
structure, and the two matches

158
00:10:00,130 --> 00:10:05,480
the y, and the three
matches the z.

159
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:09,560
But now, supposing I were to
compare this x dot y--

160
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:12,460
this is x dot y--

161
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:16,010
supposing I compare that with
a list of three arguments,

162
00:10:16,010 --> 00:10:18,510
one, two, three.

163
00:10:18,510 --> 00:10:20,000
Let's look at that again.

164
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:28,000


165
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,930
One, two, three--

166
00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:34,970
Well, I can walk along here and
say, oh yes, x matches the

167
00:10:34,970 --> 00:10:43,740
one, the y matches the list,
which is two and three.

168
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:47,150
So the notation I'm choosing
here is one that's very

169
00:10:47,150 --> 00:10:50,160
natural for Lisp system.

170
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:52,660


171
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:54,790
But I'm going to choose this as
a notation for representing

172
00:10:54,790 --> 00:10:56,040
a bunch of arguments.

173
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:58,290


174
00:10:58,290 --> 00:11:00,770
Now, there's an alternative
possibility.

175
00:11:00,770 --> 00:11:03,560
If I don't want to take one
special out, or two special

176
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:07,300
ones out or something like that,
if I don't want to do

177
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:11,420
that, if I want to talk about
just the list of all the

178
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:16,950
arguments like in addition, well
then the argument list

179
00:11:16,950 --> 00:11:20,370
I'm going to choose to be that
procedure of all the arguments

180
00:11:20,370 --> 00:11:25,140
x which does something with x.

181
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:29,190
And which, for example, if I
take the procedure, which

182
00:11:29,190 --> 00:11:35,040
takes all the arguments x and
returned the list of them,

183
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:45,850
that's list. That's the
procedure list.

184
00:11:45,850 --> 00:11:46,840
How does this work?

185
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:49,610
Well, indeed what I had as the
bound variable list in this

186
00:11:49,610 --> 00:11:52,450
case, whatever it is,
is being matched

187
00:11:52,450 --> 00:11:55,140
against a list of arguments.

188
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:57,145
This symbol now is all
of the arguments.

189
00:11:57,145 --> 00:12:01,490


190
00:12:01,490 --> 00:12:03,830
And so this is the choice I'm
making for a particular

191
00:12:03,830 --> 00:12:08,060
syntactic specification, for the
description of procedures

192
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:10,285
which take indefinite numbers
of arguments.

193
00:12:10,285 --> 00:12:13,190


194
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:18,420
There are two cases of it,
this one and this one.

195
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:21,330
When you make syntactic
specifications, it's important

196
00:12:21,330 --> 00:12:26,410
that it's unambiguous, that
neither of these can be

197
00:12:26,410 --> 00:12:31,100
confused with a representation
we already have, this one.

198
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:33,610


199
00:12:33,610 --> 00:12:38,350
I can always tell whether
I have a fixed number of

200
00:12:38,350 --> 00:12:41,180
explicitly named arguments
made by these formal

201
00:12:41,180 --> 00:12:45,470
parameters, or a fixed number
of named formal parameters

202
00:12:45,470 --> 00:12:49,240
followed by a thing which picks
up all the rest of them,

203
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:54,620
or a list of all the arguments
which will be matched against

204
00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:57,170
this particular formal parameter
called x, because

205
00:12:57,170 --> 00:12:58,465
these are syntactically
distinguishable.

206
00:12:58,465 --> 00:13:02,250


207
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:05,960
Many languages make terrible
errors in that form where

208
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:08,340
whole segments of interpretation
are cut off,

209
00:13:08,340 --> 00:13:14,560
because there are syntactic
ambiguities in the language.

210
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,330
They are the traditional
problems with ALGOL like

211
00:13:16,330 --> 00:13:22,810
languages having to do with
the nesting of ifs in the

212
00:13:22,810 --> 00:13:25,060
predicate part.

213
00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:30,510
In any case, now, so I've told
you about the syntax, now,

214
00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:35,250
what are we going to do about
the semantics of this?

215
00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:36,590
How do we interpret it?

216
00:13:36,590 --> 00:13:38,440
Well this is just super easy.

217
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:39,900
I'm going to modify
the metacircular

218
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:43,396
interpreter to do it.

219
00:13:43,396 --> 00:13:46,020
And that's a one liner.

220
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:47,590
There it is.

221
00:13:47,590 --> 00:13:49,560
I'm changing the way
you pair things up.

222
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:56,390


223
00:13:56,390 --> 00:14:06,070
Here's the procedure that
pairs the variables, the

224
00:14:06,070 --> 00:14:12,090
formal parameters, with the
arguments that were passed

225
00:14:12,090 --> 00:14:16,080
from the last description of the
metacircular interpreter.

226
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:18,960


227
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:20,840
And here's some things
that are the same

228
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:22,670
as they were before.

229
00:14:22,670 --> 00:14:25,880
In other words, if the list of
variables is empty, then if

230
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:31,050
the list of values is empty,
then I have an empty list.

231
00:14:31,050 --> 00:14:36,890
Otherwise, I have too many
arguments, that is, if I have

232
00:14:36,890 --> 00:14:41,580
empty variables but
not empty values.

233
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:47,713
If I have empty values, but the
variables are not empty, I

234
00:14:47,713 --> 00:14:50,090
have too few arguments.

235
00:14:50,090 --> 00:14:51,340
The variables are a symbol--

236
00:14:51,340 --> 00:14:55,620


237
00:14:55,620 --> 00:14:58,130
interesting case--

238
00:14:58,130 --> 00:15:04,040
then, what I should do is say,
oh yes, this is the special

239
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:06,255
case that I have a
symbolic tail.

240
00:15:06,255 --> 00:15:09,010


241
00:15:09,010 --> 00:15:14,900
I have here a thing just like
we looked over here.

242
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:18,630
This is a tail which
is a symbol, y.

243
00:15:18,630 --> 00:15:20,730
It's not a nil.

244
00:15:20,730 --> 00:15:24,290
It's not the empty list. Here's
a symbolic tail that is

245
00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:25,600
just the very beginning
of the tail.

246
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,790
There is nothing else.

247
00:15:27,790 --> 00:15:36,540
In that case, I wish to match
that variable with all the

248
00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:44,500
values and add that to the
pairing that I'm making.

249
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:47,660
Otherwise, I go through the
normal arrangement of making

250
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:48,910
up the whole pairing.

251
00:15:48,910 --> 00:15:52,020


252
00:15:52,020 --> 00:15:54,510
I suppose that's very simple.

253
00:15:54,510 --> 00:15:57,080
And that's all there is to it.

254
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:58,330
And now I'll answer
some questions.

255
00:15:58,330 --> 00:16:02,620


256
00:16:02,620 --> 00:16:04,220
The first one--

257
00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:06,600
Are there any questions?

258
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:06,950
Yes?

259
00:16:06,950 --> 00:16:10,450
AUDIENCE: Could you explain
that third form?

260
00:16:10,450 --> 00:16:12,590
PROFESSOR: This one?

261
00:16:12,590 --> 00:16:15,280
Well, maybe we should look
at the thing as a

262
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:18,570
piece of list structure.

263
00:16:18,570 --> 00:16:22,400
This is a procedure which
contains a lambda.

264
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:25,970


265
00:16:25,970 --> 00:16:27,110
I'm just looking at
the list structure

266
00:16:27,110 --> 00:16:31,090
which represents this.

267
00:16:31,090 --> 00:16:32,730
Here's x.

268
00:16:32,730 --> 00:16:33,980
These are our symbols.

269
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:37,410


270
00:16:37,410 --> 00:16:39,580
And then the body is
nothing but x.

271
00:16:39,580 --> 00:16:44,840


272
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:48,040
If I were looking for the bound
variable list part of

273
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:52,400
this procedure, I would go
looking at the CADR, and I'd

274
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:54,010
find a symbol.

275
00:16:54,010 --> 00:16:56,750
So the, naturally, which is
this pairup thing I just

276
00:16:56,750 --> 00:17:01,570
showed you, is going to be
matching a symbolic object

277
00:17:01,570 --> 00:17:05,760
against a list of arguments
that were passed.

278
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:09,559
And it will bind that symbol
to the list of arguments.

279
00:17:09,559 --> 00:17:13,910


280
00:17:13,910 --> 00:17:18,560
In this case, if I'm looking
for it, the match will be

281
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:20,920
against this in the bound
variable list position.

282
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:24,140


283
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:27,020
Now, if what this does is it
gets a list of arguments and

284
00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:31,450
returns it, that's list. That's
what the procedure is.

285
00:17:31,450 --> 00:17:34,510


286
00:17:34,510 --> 00:17:36,140
Oh well, thank you.

287
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:37,830
Let's take a break.

288
00:17:37,830 --> 00:18:20,358
[MUSIC PLAYING]

289
00:18:20,358 --> 00:18:23,260
PROFESSOR: Well let's see.

290
00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:24,760
Now, I'm going to tell you
about a rather more

291
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:32,440
substantial variation, one
that's a famous variation that

292
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:38,250
many early Lisps had.

293
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:41,770
It's called dynamic binding
of variables.

294
00:18:41,770 --> 00:18:44,680
And we'll investigate a little
bit about that right now.

295
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:47,620


296
00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:49,710
I'm going to first introduce
this by showing you the sort

297
00:18:49,710 --> 00:18:53,740
of thing that would make
someone want this idea.

298
00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:56,680
I'm not going to tell what it is
yet, I'm going to show you

299
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:58,640
why you might want it.

300
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:02,100
Suppose, for example, we looked
at the sum procedure

301
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:08,140
again for summing up
a bunch of things.

302
00:19:08,140 --> 00:19:15,860
To be that procedure, of a term,
lower bound, method of

303
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:25,560
computing the next index, and
upper bound, such that, if a

304
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:34,020
is greater than b then the
result is 0, otherwise, it's

305
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:40,680
the sum, of the term, procedure,
applied to a and

306
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:51,925
the result of adding up, terms,
with the next a being

307
00:19:51,925 --> 00:20:06,970
the a, the next procedure passed
along, and the upper

308
00:20:06,970 --> 00:20:08,220
bound being passed along.

309
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:14,510


310
00:20:14,510 --> 00:20:15,760
Blink, blink, blink--

311
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:18,900


312
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:23,350
Now, when I use this sum
procedure, I can use it, for

313
00:20:23,350 --> 00:20:25,450
example, like this.

314
00:20:25,450 --> 00:20:38,680
We can define the sum of the
powers to be, for example, sum

315
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:43,240
of a bunch of powers x to the
n, to be that procedure

316
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:45,970
of a, b, and n--

317
00:20:45,970 --> 00:20:48,150
lower bound, the upper
bound, and n--

318
00:20:48,150 --> 00:20:54,530
which is sum, of lambda of x,
the procedure of one argument

319
00:20:54,530 --> 00:21:05,720
x, which exponentiates x to
the n, with the a, the

320
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:11,440
incrementer, and b, being
passed along.

321
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:16,340
So we're adding up x
to n, given an x.

322
00:21:16,340 --> 00:21:19,740
x takes on values from a to
b, incrementing by one.

323
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:22,940


324
00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:24,300
I can also write the--

325
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:27,670


326
00:21:27,670 --> 00:21:29,780
That's right.

327
00:21:29,780 --> 00:21:31,910
Product, excuse me.

328
00:21:31,910 --> 00:21:33,220
The product of a bunch
of powers.

329
00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:38,080


330
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:40,020
It's a strange name.

331
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:41,960
I'm going to leave it there.

332
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:43,210
Weird--

333
00:21:43,210 --> 00:21:45,760


334
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:50,890
I write up what I have.
I'm sure that's right.

335
00:21:50,890 --> 00:21:53,720
And if I want the product
of a bunch of powers--

336
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:58,630


337
00:21:58,630 --> 00:22:03,400
That was 12 brain cells,
that double-take.

338
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:06,890
I can for example use the
procedure which is like sum,

339
00:22:06,890 --> 00:22:10,080
which is for making products,
but it's similar to that, that

340
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:11,450
you've seen before.

341
00:22:11,450 --> 00:22:16,725
There's a procedure of three
arguments again.

342
00:22:16,725 --> 00:22:24,080
Which is the product of terms
that are constructed, or

343
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:26,480
factors in this case,
constructed from

344
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:35,970
exponentiating x to the n,
where I start with a, I

345
00:22:35,970 --> 00:22:37,850
increment, and I go to b.

346
00:22:37,850 --> 00:22:41,530


347
00:22:41,530 --> 00:22:48,690
Now, there's some sort of thing
here that should disturb

348
00:22:48,690 --> 00:22:50,750
you immediately.

349
00:22:50,750 --> 00:22:53,180
These look the same.

350
00:22:53,180 --> 00:22:56,590
Why am I writing this
code so many times?

351
00:22:56,590 --> 00:23:01,270
Here I am, in the same boat
I've been in before.

352
00:23:01,270 --> 00:23:03,810
Wouldn't it be nice to make
an abstraction here?

353
00:23:03,810 --> 00:23:05,980
What's an example of a good
abstraction to make?

354
00:23:05,980 --> 00:23:08,470
Well, I see some codes
that's identical.

355
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:11,080
Here's one, and here's
another.

356
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:14,450


357
00:23:14,450 --> 00:23:17,090
And so maybe I should be
able to pull that out.

358
00:23:17,090 --> 00:23:21,580
I should be able to say, oh
yes, the sum of the powers

359
00:23:21,580 --> 00:23:23,350
could be written in terms
of something called

360
00:23:23,350 --> 00:23:25,710
the nth power procedure.

361
00:23:25,710 --> 00:23:28,690
Imagine somebody wanted to write
a slightly different

362
00:23:28,690 --> 00:23:30,030
procedure that looks
like this.

363
00:23:30,030 --> 00:23:37,630


364
00:23:37,630 --> 00:23:49,300
The sum powers to be a procedure
of a, b, and n, as

365
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:53,556
the result of summing
up the nth power.

366
00:23:53,556 --> 00:23:59,720
We're going to give a name to
that idea, for starting at a,

367
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:02,170
going by one, and ending at b.

368
00:24:02,170 --> 00:24:06,000


369
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:12,480
And similarly, I might want to
write the product powers this

370
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:16,270
way, abstracting
out this idea.

371
00:24:16,270 --> 00:24:17,520
I might want this.

372
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:22,100


373
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:35,350
Product powers, to be a
procedure of a, b, and n,

374
00:24:35,350 --> 00:24:47,540
which is the product of the nth
power operation on a with

375
00:24:47,540 --> 00:24:56,380
the incrementation and b being
my arguments for the

376
00:24:56,380 --> 00:24:58,380
analogous-thing product.

377
00:24:58,380 --> 00:25:02,840
And I'd like to be able to
define, I'd like to be able to

378
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:04,680
define nth power--

379
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:05,930
I'll put it over here.

380
00:25:05,930 --> 00:25:11,215


381
00:25:11,215 --> 00:25:12,990
I'll put it at the top.

382
00:25:12,990 --> 00:25:25,410


383
00:25:25,410 --> 00:25:30,630
--to be, in fact, my procedure
of one argument x which is the

384
00:25:30,630 --> 00:25:35,390
result of exponentiating
x to the n.

385
00:25:35,390 --> 00:25:38,640
But I have a problem.

386
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:44,160
My environment model, that is my
means of interpretation for

387
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:47,010
the language that we've defined
so far, does not give

388
00:25:47,010 --> 00:25:48,810
me a meaning for this n.

389
00:25:48,810 --> 00:25:52,520


390
00:25:52,520 --> 00:26:06,410
Because, as you know, this n
is free in this procedure.

391
00:26:06,410 --> 00:26:09,600
The environment model tells us
that the meaning of a free

392
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:13,760
variable is determined in the
environment in which this

393
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:16,640
procedure is defined.

394
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:18,120
In a way I have written it,
assuming these things are

395
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:22,830
defined on the blackboard as
is, this is defined in the

396
00:26:22,830 --> 00:26:25,850
global environment, where
there is no end.

397
00:26:25,850 --> 00:26:28,720
Therefore, n is unbound
variable.

398
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:33,390
But it's perfectly clear, to
most of us, that we would like

399
00:26:33,390 --> 00:26:36,220
it to be this n and this n.

400
00:26:36,220 --> 00:26:38,990


401
00:26:38,990 --> 00:26:42,840
On the other hand,
it would be nice.

402
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:45,290
Certainly we've got to be
careful here of keeping this

403
00:26:45,290 --> 00:26:51,005
to be this, and this one
over here, wherever it

404
00:26:51,005 --> 00:26:52,900
is to be this one.

405
00:26:52,900 --> 00:26:57,390


406
00:26:57,390 --> 00:27:01,360
Well, the desire to make
this work has led to

407
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:04,040
a very famous bug.

408
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:07,310
I'll tell you about
the famous bug.

409
00:27:07,310 --> 00:27:10,660
Look at this slide.

410
00:27:10,660 --> 00:27:13,990
This is an idea called
dynamic binding.

411
00:27:13,990 --> 00:27:17,980
Where, instead of the free
variable being interpreted in

412
00:27:17,980 --> 00:27:22,820
the environment of definition
of a procedure, the free

413
00:27:22,820 --> 00:27:25,770
variable is interpreted as
having its value in the

414
00:27:25,770 --> 00:27:29,125
environment of the caller
of the procedure.

415
00:27:29,125 --> 00:27:31,850


416
00:27:31,850 --> 00:27:36,680
So what you have is a system
where you search up the chain

417
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:41,990
of callers of a particular
procedure, and, of course, in

418
00:27:41,990 --> 00:27:45,240
this case, since nth power is
called from inside product

419
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:46,010
whatever it is--

420
00:27:46,010 --> 00:27:48,140
I had to write our own sum
which is the analogous

421
00:27:48,140 --> 00:27:50,530
procedure--

422
00:27:50,530 --> 00:27:55,300
and product is presumably called
from product powers, as

423
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:58,490
you see over here, then since
product powers bind with

424
00:27:58,490 --> 00:28:03,220
variable n , then nth powers
n would be derived

425
00:28:03,220 --> 00:28:04,470
through that chain.

426
00:28:04,470 --> 00:28:08,140


427
00:28:08,140 --> 00:28:12,600
Similarly, this n, the nth power
in n in this case, would

428
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:15,800
come through nth power here
being called from inside sum.

429
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:19,730
You can see it being called
from inside sum here.

430
00:28:19,730 --> 00:28:22,900
It's called term here.

431
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:28,930
But sum was called from inside
of sum powers, which bound n.

432
00:28:28,930 --> 00:28:35,245
Therefore, there would be an n
available for that n to get

433
00:28:35,245 --> 00:28:36,495
it's value from.

434
00:28:36,495 --> 00:28:39,430


435
00:28:39,430 --> 00:28:43,630
What we have below this white
line plus over here, is what's

436
00:28:43,630 --> 00:28:46,540
called a dynamic binding
view of the world.

437
00:28:46,540 --> 00:28:50,850
If that works, that's a
dynamic binding view.

438
00:28:50,850 --> 00:28:55,310
Now, let's take a look, for
example, at just what it takes

439
00:28:55,310 --> 00:28:55,990
to implement that.

440
00:28:55,990 --> 00:28:57,480
That's real easy.

441
00:28:57,480 --> 00:29:01,400
In fact, the very first Lisps
that had any interpretations

442
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:04,440
of the free variables at all,
had dynamic binding

443
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:06,490
interpretations for the
free variables.

444
00:29:06,490 --> 00:29:09,570
APL has dynamic binding
interpretation for the free

445
00:29:09,570 --> 00:29:15,220
variables, not lexical
or static binding.

446
00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:18,790
So, of course, the change
is in eval.

447
00:29:18,790 --> 00:29:22,780
And it's really in two places.

448
00:29:22,780 --> 00:29:27,760
First of all, one thing we see,
is that things become a

449
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:29,010
little simpler.

450
00:29:29,010 --> 00:29:32,460


451
00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:34,930
If I don't have to have the
environment be the environment

452
00:29:34,930 --> 00:29:38,490
of definition for procedure, the
procedure need not capture

453
00:29:38,490 --> 00:29:42,030
the environment at the
time it's defined.

454
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:47,900
And so if we look here at this
slide, we see that the clause

455
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:51,890
for a lambda expression, which
is the way a procedure is

456
00:29:51,890 --> 00:29:57,820
defined, does not make up a
thing which has a type closure

457
00:29:57,820 --> 00:30:01,290
and a attached environment
structure.

458
00:30:01,290 --> 00:30:02,540
It's just the expression
itself.

459
00:30:02,540 --> 00:30:06,440
And we'll decompose that some
other way somewhere else.

460
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:12,210
The other thing we see is the
applicator must be able to get

461
00:30:12,210 --> 00:30:14,290
the environment of the caller.

462
00:30:14,290 --> 00:30:19,560
The caller of a procedure
is right here.

463
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:22,810
If the expression we're
evaluating is anpplication or

464
00:30:22,810 --> 00:30:25,680
a combination, then we're going
to call a procedure

465
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:26,980
which is the value
of the operator.

466
00:30:26,980 --> 00:30:29,840


467
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:33,100
The environment of the caller
is the environment we have

468
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:35,890
right here, available now.

469
00:30:35,890 --> 00:30:38,570
So all I have to do is pass
that environment to the

470
00:30:38,570 --> 00:30:41,490
applicator, to apply.

471
00:30:41,490 --> 00:30:44,680
And if we look at that here,
the only change we have to

472
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:49,720
make is that fellow takes that
environment and uses that

473
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:57,240
environment for the purpose of
extending that environment

474
00:30:57,240 --> 00:31:00,100
when abiding the formal
parameters of the procedure to

475
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:04,560
the arguments that were passed,
not an environment

476
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:06,810
that was captured in
the procedure.

477
00:31:06,810 --> 00:31:09,780
The reason why the first Lisps
were implemented this way, is

478
00:31:09,780 --> 00:31:14,130
the sort of the obvious,
accidental implementation.

479
00:31:14,130 --> 00:31:15,990
And, of course, as usual,
people got used to

480
00:31:15,990 --> 00:31:17,250
it and liked it.

481
00:31:17,250 --> 00:31:18,730
And there were some people
said, this is

482
00:31:18,730 --> 00:31:21,590
the way to do it.

483
00:31:21,590 --> 00:31:25,870
Unfortunately that causes some
serious problems. The most

484
00:31:25,870 --> 00:31:31,240
important, serious problem in
using dynamic binding is

485
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:35,460
there's a modularity crisis
that's involved it.

486
00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:38,370
If two people are working
together on some big system,

487
00:31:38,370 --> 00:31:41,580
then an important thing to want
is that the names used by

488
00:31:41,580 --> 00:31:44,580
each one don't interfere with
the names of the other.

489
00:31:44,580 --> 00:31:47,930


490
00:31:47,930 --> 00:31:51,060
It's important that when I
invent some segment of code

491
00:31:51,060 --> 00:31:54,985
that no one can make my code
stop working by using my names

492
00:31:54,985 --> 00:31:59,850
that I use internal to my code,
internal to his code.

493
00:31:59,850 --> 00:32:03,140
However, dynamic binding
violates that particular

494
00:32:03,140 --> 00:32:06,670
modularity constraint
in a clear way.

495
00:32:06,670 --> 00:32:12,540
Consider, for example, what
happens over here.

496
00:32:12,540 --> 00:32:17,590
Suppose it was the case
that I decided to

497
00:32:17,590 --> 00:32:19,810
change the word next.

498
00:32:19,810 --> 00:32:25,870
Supposing somebody is writing
sum, and somebody else is

499
00:32:25,870 --> 00:32:28,970
going to use sum.

500
00:32:28,970 --> 00:32:33,790
The writer of sum has a choice
of what names he may use.

501
00:32:33,790 --> 00:32:36,760
Let's say, I'm that writer.

502
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:39,300
Well, by gosh, just happens I
didn't want to call this next.

503
00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:41,500
I called it n.

504
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:48,140
So all places where you see
next, I called it n.

505
00:32:48,140 --> 00:32:49,940
Whoops.

506
00:32:49,940 --> 00:32:51,700
I changed nothing about the
specifications of this

507
00:32:51,700 --> 00:32:56,110
program, but this program
stops working.

508
00:32:56,110 --> 00:32:59,730
Not only that, unfortunately,
this one does too.

509
00:32:59,730 --> 00:33:02,260
Why do these programs
stop working?

510
00:33:02,260 --> 00:33:04,480
Well, it's sort of clear.

511
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:09,890
Instead of chasing out the value
of the n that occurs in

512
00:33:09,890 --> 00:33:16,450
nth power over here or over
here, through the environment

513
00:33:16,450 --> 00:33:19,940
of definition, where this one is
always linked to this one,

514
00:33:19,940 --> 00:33:21,660
if it was through the
environment of definition,

515
00:33:21,660 --> 00:33:24,370
because here is the
definition.

516
00:33:24,370 --> 00:33:27,320
This lambda expression was
executed in the environment

517
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:30,700
where that n was defined.

518
00:33:30,700 --> 00:33:33,150
If instead of doing that, I have
to chase through the call

519
00:33:33,150 --> 00:33:37,320
chain, then look what horrible
thing happens.

520
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:44,780
Well, this was called from
inside sum as term, term a.

521
00:33:44,780 --> 00:33:47,350
I'm looking for a value of n.

522
00:33:47,350 --> 00:33:50,700
Instead of getting this
one, I get that one.

523
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:53,430
So by changing the insides of
this program, this program

524
00:33:53,430 --> 00:33:54,680
stops working.

525
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:56,770


526
00:33:56,770 --> 00:33:58,770
So I no longer have
a quantifier,

527
00:33:58,770 --> 00:34:00,020
as I described before.

528
00:34:00,020 --> 00:34:02,700


529
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:05,430
The lambda symbol is supposed
to be a quantifier.

530
00:34:05,430 --> 00:34:09,650
A thing which has the property
that the names that are bound

531
00:34:09,650 --> 00:34:14,739
by it are unimportant, that I
can uniformly substitute any

532
00:34:14,739 --> 00:34:18,230
names for these throughout this
thing, so long as they

533
00:34:18,230 --> 00:34:21,699
don't occur in here, the new
names, and the meaning of this

534
00:34:21,699 --> 00:34:24,040
expression should remain
unchanged.

535
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:26,050
I've just changed the meaning of
the expression by changing

536
00:34:26,050 --> 00:34:28,690
the one of the names.

537
00:34:28,690 --> 00:34:32,170
So lambda is no longer
a well defined idea.

538
00:34:32,170 --> 00:34:34,550
It's a very serious problem.

539
00:34:34,550 --> 00:34:40,850
So for that reason, I and my
buddies have given up this

540
00:34:40,850 --> 00:34:43,650
particular kind of abstraction,
which I would

541
00:34:43,650 --> 00:34:48,090
like to have, in favor of
a modularity principle.

542
00:34:48,090 --> 00:34:52,310
But this is the kind of
experiment you can do if you

543
00:34:52,310 --> 00:34:54,530
want to play with these
interpreters.

544
00:34:54,530 --> 00:34:58,270
You can try them out this way,
that way, and the other way.

545
00:34:58,270 --> 00:35:00,070
You see what makes
a nicer language.

546
00:35:00,070 --> 00:35:02,680


547
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:04,990
So that's a very important
thing to be able to do.

548
00:35:04,990 --> 00:35:07,260
Now, I would like to give you
a feeling for I think the

549
00:35:07,260 --> 00:35:10,880
right thing to do is here.

550
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:14,190
How are you going to I get
this kind of power in a

551
00:35:14,190 --> 00:35:16,280
lexical system?

552
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:18,610
And the answer is, of course,
what I really want is a

553
00:35:18,610 --> 00:35:21,790
something that makes up for
me an exponentiator for a

554
00:35:21,790 --> 00:35:23,690
particular n.

555
00:35:23,690 --> 00:35:26,280
Given an n, it will make
me an exponentiator.

556
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:28,170
Oh, but that's easy too.

557
00:35:28,170 --> 00:35:30,570
In other words, I can write
my program this way.

558
00:35:30,570 --> 00:35:35,450


559
00:35:35,450 --> 00:35:40,720
I'm going to define a thing
called PGEN, which is a

560
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:45,240
procedure of n which produces
for me an exponentiator.

561
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:50,240


562
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:51,490
--x to the n.

563
00:35:51,490 --> 00:35:56,900


564
00:35:56,900 --> 00:36:00,310
Given that I have that, then I
can capture the abstraction I

565
00:36:00,310 --> 00:36:04,090
wanted even better, because now
it's encapsulated in a way

566
00:36:04,090 --> 00:36:07,890
where I can't be destroyed
by a change of names.

567
00:36:07,890 --> 00:36:20,200
I can define some powers to be a
procedure again of a, b, and

568
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:28,070
n which is the sum of the term
function generated by using

569
00:36:28,070 --> 00:36:37,590
this generator, PGEN, n, with
a, incrementer, and b.

570
00:36:37,590 --> 00:36:42,490


571
00:36:42,490 --> 00:36:57,100
And I can define the product of
powers to be a procedure of

572
00:36:57,100 --> 00:37:09,010
a, b, and n which is the product
PGEN, n, with a,

573
00:37:09,010 --> 00:37:11,150
increment, and b.

574
00:37:11,150 --> 00:37:14,340
Now, of course, this is a very
simple example where this

575
00:37:14,340 --> 00:37:17,280
object that I'm trying to
abstract over is small.

576
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:20,100
But it could be a 100
lines of code.

577
00:37:20,100 --> 00:37:22,350
And so, the purpose
of this is, of

578
00:37:22,350 --> 00:37:23,670
course, to make it simple.

579
00:37:23,670 --> 00:37:25,630
I'd give a name to it, it's
just that here it's a

580
00:37:25,630 --> 00:37:28,200
parameterized name.

581
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:31,460
It's a name that depends upon,
explicitly, the lexically

582
00:37:31,460 --> 00:37:34,050
apparent value of n.

583
00:37:34,050 --> 00:37:37,130


584
00:37:37,130 --> 00:37:40,210
So you can think of this
as a long name.

585
00:37:40,210 --> 00:37:45,150
And here, I've solved my problem
by naming the term

586
00:37:45,150 --> 00:37:49,220
generation procedures
within an n in them.

587
00:37:49,220 --> 00:37:55,080


588
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:57,140
Are there any questions?

589
00:37:57,140 --> 00:37:58,380
Oh, yes, David.

590
00:37:58,380 --> 00:38:04,820
AUDIENCE: Is the only solution
to the problem you raise to

591
00:38:04,820 --> 00:38:06,470
create another procedure?

592
00:38:06,470 --> 00:38:09,020
In other words, can this only
work in languages that are

593
00:38:09,020 --> 00:38:12,402
capable of defining objects
as procedures?

594
00:38:12,402 --> 00:38:13,765
PROFESSOR: Oh, I see.

595
00:38:13,765 --> 00:38:16,530


596
00:38:16,530 --> 00:38:20,530
My solution to making this
abstraction, when I didn't

597
00:38:20,530 --> 00:38:23,950
want include the procedure
inside the body, depends upon

598
00:38:23,950 --> 00:38:28,190
my ability to return a procedure
or export one.

599
00:38:28,190 --> 00:38:30,410
And that's right.

600
00:38:30,410 --> 00:38:33,550
If I don't have that, then I
just don't have this ability

601
00:38:33,550 --> 00:38:39,490
to make an abstraction in
a way where I don't have

602
00:38:39,490 --> 00:38:40,930
possibilities of symbol
conflicts that were

603
00:38:40,930 --> 00:38:43,000
unanticipated.

604
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,610
That's right.

605
00:38:45,610 --> 00:38:52,690
I consider being able to return
the procedural value

606
00:38:52,690 --> 00:38:57,780
and, therefore, to sort of have
first class procedures,

607
00:38:57,780 --> 00:39:01,840
in general, as being essential
to doing very good modular

608
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:03,700
programming.

609
00:39:03,700 --> 00:39:07,440
Now, indeed there are many other
ways to skin this cat.

610
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:10,500
What you can do is take for each
of the bad things that

611
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:13,420
you have to worry about, you
can make a special feature

612
00:39:13,420 --> 00:39:15,840
that covers that thing.

613
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:17,930
You can make a package system.

614
00:39:17,930 --> 00:39:22,240
You can make a module system
as in Ada, et cetera.

615
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:26,440
And all of those work, or they
cover little regions of it.

616
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:28,820
The thing is that returning
procedures as values cover all

617
00:39:28,820 --> 00:39:35,820
of those problems. And so it's
the simplest mechanism that

618
00:39:35,820 --> 00:39:40,110
gives you the best modularity,
gives you all of the known

619
00:39:40,110 --> 00:39:45,590
modularity mechanisms.

620
00:39:45,590 --> 00:39:48,248
Well, I suppose it's time for
the next break, thank you.

621
00:39:48,248 --> 00:40:41,871
[MUSIC PLAYING]

622
00:40:41,871 --> 00:40:43,690
PROFESSOR: Well, yesterday
when you learned about

623
00:40:43,690 --> 00:40:52,110
streams, Hal worried to you
about the order of evaluation

624
00:40:52,110 --> 00:40:55,420
and delayed arguments
to procedures.

625
00:40:55,420 --> 00:41:00,620
The way we played with streams
yesterday, it was the

626
00:41:00,620 --> 00:41:07,170
responsibility of the caller and
the callee to both agree

627
00:41:07,170 --> 00:41:12,180
that an argument was delayed,
and the callee must force the

628
00:41:12,180 --> 00:41:15,250
argument if it needs
the answer.

629
00:41:15,250 --> 00:41:18,400
So there had to be a lot of
hand shaking between the

630
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:26,100
designer of a procedure and user
of it over delayedness.

631
00:41:26,100 --> 00:41:29,670
That turns out, of course, to
be a fairly bad thing, it

632
00:41:29,670 --> 00:41:33,120
works all right with streams.
But as a general thing, what

633
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:37,520
you want is an idea to have a
locus, a decision, a design

634
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:40,580
decision in general, to have
a place where it's made,

635
00:41:40,580 --> 00:41:45,900
explicitly, and notated
in a clear way.

636
00:41:45,900 --> 00:41:48,780
And so it's not a very good
idea to have to have an

637
00:41:48,780 --> 00:41:52,670
agreement, between the person
who writes a procedure and the

638
00:41:52,670 --> 00:41:56,730
person who calls it, about such
details as, maybe, the

639
00:41:56,730 --> 00:41:59,500
arguments of evaluation, the
order of evaluation.

640
00:41:59,500 --> 00:42:00,750
Although, that's not so bad.

641
00:42:00,750 --> 00:42:02,920
I mean, we have other such
agreements like,

642
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:04,540
the input's a number.

643
00:42:04,540 --> 00:42:07,650
But it would be nice if only one
of these guys could take

644
00:42:07,650 --> 00:42:11,020
responsibility, completely.

645
00:42:11,020 --> 00:42:15,510
Now this is not a new idea.

646
00:42:15,510 --> 00:42:22,020
ALGOL 60 had two different ways
of calling a procedure.

647
00:42:22,020 --> 00:42:25,590
The arguments could be passed
by name or by value.

648
00:42:25,590 --> 00:42:31,110
And what that meant was that a
name argument was delayed.

649
00:42:31,110 --> 00:42:34,020
That when you passed an argument
by name, that its

650
00:42:34,020 --> 00:42:39,620
value would only be obtained if
you accessed that argument.

651
00:42:39,620 --> 00:42:42,290


652
00:42:42,290 --> 00:42:45,870
So what I'd like to do now is
show you, first of all, a

653
00:42:45,870 --> 00:42:48,040
little bit about, again, we're
going to make a modification

654
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:50,320
to a language.

655
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:53,370
In this case, we're going
to add a feature.

656
00:42:53,370 --> 00:42:56,900
We're going to add the feature
of, by name parameters, if you

657
00:42:56,900 --> 00:43:00,430
will, or delayed parameters.

658
00:43:00,430 --> 00:43:05,580
Because, in fact, the default
in our Lisp system is by the

659
00:43:05,580 --> 00:43:08,220
value of a pointer.

660
00:43:08,220 --> 00:43:10,530
A pointer is copied, but
the data structure it

661
00:43:10,530 --> 00:43:13,410
points at is not.

662
00:43:13,410 --> 00:43:17,580
But I'd like to, in fact, show
you is how you add name

663
00:43:17,580 --> 00:43:19,990
arguments as well.

664
00:43:19,990 --> 00:43:23,100
Now again, why would we
need such a thing?

665
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:26,930
Well supposing we wanted to
invent certain kinds of what

666
00:43:26,930 --> 00:43:29,720
otherwise would be special
forms, reserve words?

667
00:43:29,720 --> 00:43:32,180
But I'd rather not take
up reserve words.

668
00:43:32,180 --> 00:43:36,360
I want procedures that can
do things like if.

669
00:43:36,360 --> 00:43:39,420
If is special, or cond,
or whatever it is.

670
00:43:39,420 --> 00:43:40,600
It's the same thing.

671
00:43:40,600 --> 00:43:43,080
It's special in that it
determines whether or not to

672
00:43:43,080 --> 00:43:48,360
evaluate the consequent or the
alternative based on the value

673
00:43:48,360 --> 00:43:50,840
of the predicate part
of an expression.

674
00:43:50,840 --> 00:43:54,230
So taking the value of one thing
determines whether or

675
00:43:54,230 --> 00:43:57,270
not to do something else.

676
00:43:57,270 --> 00:44:00,240
Whereas all the procedures like
plus, the ones that we

677
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:05,900
can define right now, evaluate
all of their arguments before

678
00:44:05,900 --> 00:44:08,670
application.

679
00:44:08,670 --> 00:44:11,750
So, for example, supposing I
wish to be able to define

680
00:44:11,750 --> 00:44:19,452
something like the reverse
of if in terms of if.

681
00:44:19,452 --> 00:44:20,702
Call it unless.

682
00:44:20,702 --> 00:44:24,890


683
00:44:24,890 --> 00:44:26,760
We've a predicate, a
consequent, and an

684
00:44:26,760 --> 00:44:28,190
alternative.

685
00:44:28,190 --> 00:44:30,995
Now what I would like to sort of
be able to do is say-- oh,

686
00:44:30,995 --> 00:44:32,440
I'll do it in terms of cond.

687
00:44:32,440 --> 00:44:41,660
Cond, if not the predicate,
then take the consequent,

688
00:44:41,660 --> 00:44:45,350
otherwise, take the
alternative.

689
00:44:45,350 --> 00:44:51,290


690
00:44:51,290 --> 00:44:54,320
Now, what I'd like this to
mean, is supposing I do

691
00:44:54,320 --> 00:44:56,920
something like this.

692
00:44:56,920 --> 00:45:05,860
I'd like this unless say if
equals one, 0, then the answer

693
00:45:05,860 --> 00:45:11,350
is two, otherwise, the quotient
of one and 0.

694
00:45:11,350 --> 00:45:15,980


695
00:45:15,980 --> 00:45:20,170
What I'd like that to mean is
the result of substituting

696
00:45:20,170 --> 00:45:23,450
equal one, 0, and two, and
the quotient of one, 0

697
00:45:23,450 --> 00:45:25,580
for p, c, and a.

698
00:45:25,580 --> 00:45:28,750
I'd like that to mean, and this
is funny, I'd like it to

699
00:45:28,750 --> 00:45:40,940
transform into or mean cond
not equal one, 0, then the

700
00:45:40,940 --> 00:45:48,910
result is two, otherwise
I want it to be the

701
00:45:48,910 --> 00:45:51,160
quotient one and 0.

702
00:45:51,160 --> 00:45:54,480


703
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:56,210
Now, you know that if I
were to type this into

704
00:45:56,210 --> 00:45:59,970
Lisp, I'd get a two.

705
00:45:59,970 --> 00:46:02,910
There's no problem with that.

706
00:46:02,910 --> 00:46:05,940
However, if I were to type this
into Lisp, because all

707
00:46:05,940 --> 00:46:09,590
the arguments are evaluated
before I start, then I'm going

708
00:46:09,590 --> 00:46:10,840
to get an error out of this.

709
00:46:10,840 --> 00:46:13,380


710
00:46:13,380 --> 00:46:16,130
So that if the substitutions
work at all, of course, I

711
00:46:16,130 --> 00:46:16,880
would get the right answer.

712
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:20,160
But here's a case where the
substitutions don't work.

713
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:22,920


714
00:46:22,920 --> 00:46:23,860
I don't get the wrong answer.

715
00:46:23,860 --> 00:46:24,670
I get no answer.

716
00:46:24,670 --> 00:46:25,920
I get an error.

717
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:28,420


718
00:46:28,420 --> 00:46:31,860
Now, however, I'd like to be
able to make my definition so

719
00:46:31,860 --> 00:46:34,270
that this kind of thing works.

720
00:46:34,270 --> 00:46:36,010
What I want to do
is say something

721
00:46:36,010 --> 00:46:39,930
special about c and a.

722
00:46:39,930 --> 00:46:42,715
I want them to be delayed
automatically.

723
00:46:42,715 --> 00:46:46,300


724
00:46:46,300 --> 00:46:51,520
I don't want them to be
evaluated at the time I call.

725
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:52,980
So I'm going to make a
declaration, and then I'm

726
00:46:52,980 --> 00:46:55,600
going to see how to implement
such a declaration.

727
00:46:55,600 --> 00:46:58,870
But again, I want you to say
to yourself, oh, this is an

728
00:46:58,870 --> 00:47:02,140
interesting kluge he's
adding in here.

729
00:47:02,140 --> 00:47:05,750
The piles of kluges make
a big complicated mess.

730
00:47:05,750 --> 00:47:08,240
And is this going to
foul up something

731
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:10,120
else that might occur.

732
00:47:10,120 --> 00:47:13,860
First of all, is it
syntactically unambiguous?

733
00:47:13,860 --> 00:47:16,120
Well, it will be syntactically
unambiguous with what we've

734
00:47:16,120 --> 00:47:17,840
seen so far.

735
00:47:17,840 --> 00:47:21,670
But what I'm going to do may,
in fact, cause trouble.

736
00:47:21,670 --> 00:47:25,450
It may be that the thing I had
will conflict with type

737
00:47:25,450 --> 00:47:28,700
declarations I might want to add
in the future for giving

738
00:47:28,700 --> 00:47:31,730
some system, some compiler or
something, the ability to

739
00:47:31,730 --> 00:47:34,300
optimize given the
types are known.

740
00:47:34,300 --> 00:47:37,130
Or it might conflict with other
types of declarations I

741
00:47:37,130 --> 00:47:40,570
might want to make about
the formal parameters.

742
00:47:40,570 --> 00:47:44,520
So I'm not making a general
mechanism here where I can add

743
00:47:44,520 --> 00:47:44,925
declarations.

744
00:47:44,925 --> 00:47:46,750
And I would like to be
able to do that.

745
00:47:46,750 --> 00:47:51,010
But I don't want to talk
about that right now.

746
00:47:51,010 --> 00:47:53,680
So here I'm going to do, I'm
going to build a kluge.

747
00:47:53,680 --> 00:47:57,050


748
00:47:57,050 --> 00:48:08,770
So we're going to define
unless of a predicate--

749
00:48:08,770 --> 00:48:10,180
and I'm going to call
these by name--

750
00:48:10,180 --> 00:48:12,810


751
00:48:12,810 --> 00:48:14,930
the consequent, and name
the alternative.

752
00:48:14,930 --> 00:48:19,850


753
00:48:19,850 --> 00:48:22,670
Huh, huh--

754
00:48:22,670 --> 00:48:25,280
I got caught in the corner.

755
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:31,240


756
00:48:31,240 --> 00:48:37,165
If not p then the result
is c, else--

757
00:48:37,165 --> 00:48:40,110


758
00:48:40,110 --> 00:48:41,360
that's what I'd like.

759
00:48:41,360 --> 00:48:44,670


760
00:48:44,670 --> 00:48:49,500
Where I can explicitly declare
certain of the parameters to

761
00:48:49,500 --> 00:48:51,650
be delayed, to be
computed later.

762
00:48:51,650 --> 00:48:55,008


763
00:48:55,008 --> 00:48:57,910
Now, this is actually a very
complicated modification to an

764
00:48:57,910 --> 00:49:00,450
interpreter rather than
a simple one.

765
00:49:00,450 --> 00:49:05,270
The ones you saw before, dynamic
binding or adding

766
00:49:05,270 --> 00:49:07,630
indefinite argument procedures,

767
00:49:07,630 --> 00:49:09,280
is relatively simple.

768
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:12,120
But this one changes
a basic strategy.

769
00:49:12,120 --> 00:49:18,070
The problem here is that our
interpreter, as written,

770
00:49:18,070 --> 00:49:24,420
evaluates a combination by
evaluating the procedure, the

771
00:49:24,420 --> 00:49:26,910
operator producing the
procedure, and evaluating the

772
00:49:26,910 --> 00:49:31,410
operands producing the
arguments, and then doing

773
00:49:31,410 --> 00:49:36,110
apply of the procedure
to the arguments.

774
00:49:36,110 --> 00:49:40,540
However, here, I don't want to
evaluate the operands to

775
00:49:40,540 --> 00:49:44,640
produce the arguments until
after I examined the procedure

776
00:49:44,640 --> 00:49:46,810
to see what the procedure's
declarations look like.

777
00:49:46,810 --> 00:49:49,590


778
00:49:49,590 --> 00:49:52,680
So let's look at that.

779
00:49:52,680 --> 00:49:57,480
Here we have a changed
evaluator.

780
00:49:57,480 --> 00:50:02,110
I'm starting with the simple
lexical evaluator, not

781
00:50:02,110 --> 00:50:06,730
dynamic, but we're going to have
to do something sort of

782
00:50:06,730 --> 00:50:09,750
similar in some ways.

783
00:50:09,750 --> 00:50:13,710
Because of the fact that,
if I delay a procedure--

784
00:50:13,710 --> 00:50:15,790
I'm sorry-- delay an argument
to a procedure, I'm going to

785
00:50:15,790 --> 00:50:19,360
have to attach and environment
to it.

786
00:50:19,360 --> 00:50:23,380
Remember how Hal implemented
delay.

787
00:50:23,380 --> 00:50:28,650
Hal implemented delay as being
a procedure of no arguments

788
00:50:28,650 --> 00:50:31,180
which does some expression.

789
00:50:31,180 --> 00:50:32,670
That's what delay of
the expression is.

790
00:50:32,670 --> 00:50:35,370


791
00:50:35,370 --> 00:50:36,620
--of that expression.

792
00:50:36,620 --> 00:50:39,180


793
00:50:39,180 --> 00:50:40,950
This turned into something
like this.

794
00:50:40,950 --> 00:50:44,520


795
00:50:44,520 --> 00:50:47,760
Now, however, if I evaluate a
lambda expression, I have to

796
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:49,010
capture the environment.

797
00:50:49,010 --> 00:50:51,410


798
00:50:51,410 --> 00:50:56,920
The reason why is because there
are variables in there

799
00:50:56,920 --> 00:51:00,280
who's meaning I wish to derive
from the context where this

800
00:51:00,280 --> 00:51:01,530
was written.

801
00:51:01,530 --> 00:51:04,010


802
00:51:04,010 --> 00:51:06,095
So that's why a lambda
does the job.

803
00:51:06,095 --> 00:51:08,070
It's the right thing.

804
00:51:08,070 --> 00:51:17,070
And such that the forcing of a
delayed expression was same

805
00:51:17,070 --> 00:51:21,090
thing as calling that
with no arguments.

806
00:51:21,090 --> 00:51:24,100
It's just the opposite
of this.

807
00:51:24,100 --> 00:51:28,120
Producing an environment of the
call which is, in fact,

808
00:51:28,120 --> 00:51:31,713
the environment where this was
defined with an extra frame in

809
00:51:31,713 --> 00:51:33,132
it that's empty.

810
00:51:33,132 --> 00:51:36,240
I don't care about that.

811
00:51:36,240 --> 00:51:42,460
Well, if we go back to this
slide, since it's the case, if

812
00:51:42,460 --> 00:51:45,290
we look at this for a second,
everything is the same as it

813
00:51:45,290 --> 00:51:51,980
was before except the case of
applications or combinations.

814
00:51:51,980 --> 00:51:54,680
And combinations are going
to do two things.

815
00:51:54,680 --> 00:51:58,010
One, is I have to evaluate
the procedure--

816
00:51:58,010 --> 00:52:00,425
forget the procedure-- by
evaluating the operator.

817
00:52:00,425 --> 00:52:02,380
That's what you see
right here.

818
00:52:02,380 --> 00:52:04,990
I have to make sure that that's
current, that is not a

819
00:52:04,990 --> 00:52:08,530
delayed object, and evaluate
that to the point where it's

820
00:52:08,530 --> 00:52:10,730
forced now.

821
00:52:10,730 --> 00:52:18,460
And then I have to somehow apply
that to the operands.

822
00:52:18,460 --> 00:52:20,040
But I have to keep the
environment, pass that

823
00:52:20,040 --> 00:52:21,530
environmental along.

824
00:52:21,530 --> 00:52:23,710
So some of those operands
I may have to delay.

825
00:52:23,710 --> 00:52:29,302
I may have to attach that
environment to those operands.

826
00:52:29,302 --> 00:52:32,990
This is a rather complicated
thing happening here.

827
00:52:32,990 --> 00:52:34,240
Looking at that in apply.

828
00:52:34,240 --> 00:52:36,400


829
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:39,370
Apply, well it has a
primitive procedure

830
00:52:39,370 --> 00:52:42,610
thing just like before.

831
00:52:42,610 --> 00:52:44,390
But the compound one is a
little more interesting.

832
00:52:44,390 --> 00:52:47,250


833
00:52:47,250 --> 00:52:50,920
I have to evaluate the body,
just as before, in an

834
00:52:50,920 --> 00:52:56,010
environment which is the result
of binding some formal

835
00:52:56,010 --> 00:53:00,290
parameters to arguments
in the environment.

836
00:53:00,290 --> 00:53:01,530
That's true.

837
00:53:01,530 --> 00:53:03,070
The environment is the
one that comes from

838
00:53:03,070 --> 00:53:03,820
the procedure now.

839
00:53:03,820 --> 00:53:08,040
It's a lexical language,
statically bound.

840
00:53:08,040 --> 00:53:11,230
However, one thing I have
to do is strip off the

841
00:53:11,230 --> 00:53:12,960
declarations to get the names
of the variables.

842
00:53:12,960 --> 00:53:15,450
That's what this guy
does, vnames.

843
00:53:15,450 --> 00:53:17,940
And the other thing I have
to do is process these

844
00:53:17,940 --> 00:53:21,770
declarations, deciding which
of these operands--

845
00:53:21,770 --> 00:53:24,150
that's the operands now, as
opposed to the arguments--

846
00:53:24,150 --> 00:53:28,010
which of these operands to
evaluate, and which of them

847
00:53:28,010 --> 00:53:33,770
are to be encapsulated in
delays of some sort.

848
00:53:33,770 --> 00:53:37,280


849
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:40,720
The other thing you see here is
that we got a primitive, a

850
00:53:40,720 --> 00:53:43,170
primitive like plus, had better

851
00:53:43,170 --> 00:53:45,820
get at the real operands.

852
00:53:45,820 --> 00:53:47,690
So here is a place where we're
going to have to force them.

853
00:53:47,690 --> 00:53:49,306
And we're going to look at what
evlist is going to have

854
00:53:49,306 --> 00:53:51,340
to do a bunch of forces.

855
00:53:51,340 --> 00:53:52,780
So we have two different
kinds of evlist now.

856
00:53:52,780 --> 00:53:55,980
We have evlist and gevlist.
Gevlist is going to wrap

857
00:53:55,980 --> 00:53:59,870
delays around some things and
force others, evaluate others.

858
00:53:59,870 --> 00:54:07,900
And this guy's going to do
some forcing of things.

859
00:54:07,900 --> 00:54:10,770
Just looking at this a little
bit, this is a game you must

860
00:54:10,770 --> 00:54:12,250
play for yourself, you know.

861
00:54:12,250 --> 00:54:14,870
It's not something that you're
going to see all possible

862
00:54:14,870 --> 00:54:19,730
variations on an evaluator
talking to me.

863
00:54:19,730 --> 00:54:21,410
What you have to do is
do this for yourself.

864
00:54:21,410 --> 00:54:24,610
And after you feel this, you
play this a bit, you get to

865
00:54:24,610 --> 00:54:26,580
see all the possible design
decisions and what they might

866
00:54:26,580 --> 00:54:29,930
mean, and how they interact
with each other.

867
00:54:29,930 --> 00:54:33,160
So what languages might
have in them.

868
00:54:33,160 --> 00:54:35,340
And what are some of the
consistent sets that make a

869
00:54:35,340 --> 00:54:37,200
legitimate language.

870
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:39,135
Whereas what things are
complicated kluges that are

871
00:54:39,135 --> 00:54:41,850
just piles of junk.

872
00:54:41,850 --> 00:54:45,050
So evlist of course, over here,
just as I said, is a

873
00:54:45,050 --> 00:54:49,450
list of operands which are going
to be undelayed after

874
00:54:49,450 --> 00:54:50,750
evaluation.

875
00:54:50,750 --> 00:54:53,600
So these are going to
be forced, whatever

876
00:54:53,600 --> 00:54:56,050
that's going to mean.

877
00:54:56,050 --> 00:54:58,490
And gevlist, which is
the next thing--

878
00:54:58,490 --> 00:55:01,320


879
00:55:01,320 --> 00:55:04,040
Thank you.

880
00:55:04,040 --> 00:55:09,810
What we see here, well there's
a couple of possibilities.

881
00:55:09,810 --> 00:55:13,750
Either it's a normal, ordinary
thing, a symbol sitting there

882
00:55:13,750 --> 00:55:18,020
like the predicate in the
unless, and that's

883
00:55:18,020 --> 00:55:19,390
what we have here.

884
00:55:19,390 --> 00:55:21,710
In which case, this is intended
to be evaluated in

885
00:55:21,710 --> 00:55:23,340
applicative order.

886
00:55:23,340 --> 00:55:25,630
And it's, essentially, just
what we had before.

887
00:55:25,630 --> 00:55:30,400
It's mapping eval down the
list. In other words, I

888
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:35,690
evaluate the first expression
and continue gevlisting the

889
00:55:35,690 --> 00:55:37,900
CDR of the expression
in the environment.

890
00:55:37,900 --> 00:55:43,600
However, it's possible that
this is a name parameter.

891
00:55:43,600 --> 00:55:47,320
If it's a name parameter, I want
to put a delay in which

892
00:55:47,320 --> 00:55:53,480
combines that expression, which
I'm calling by name,

893
00:55:53,480 --> 00:55:59,250
with the environment that's
available at this time and

894
00:55:59,250 --> 00:56:02,790
passing that as the parameter.

895
00:56:02,790 --> 00:56:04,350
And this is part of the
mapping process

896
00:56:04,350 --> 00:56:05,600
that you see here.

897
00:56:05,600 --> 00:56:09,070


898
00:56:09,070 --> 00:56:12,040
The only other interesting
place in this

899
00:56:12,040 --> 00:56:14,700
interpreter is cond.

900
00:56:14,700 --> 00:56:16,440
People tend to write this thing,
and then they leave

901
00:56:16,440 --> 00:56:18,550
this one out.

902
00:56:18,550 --> 00:56:20,510
There's a place where
you have to force.

903
00:56:20,510 --> 00:56:25,260
Conditionals have to know
whether or not the answer is

904
00:56:25,260 --> 00:56:25,990
true or false.

905
00:56:25,990 --> 00:56:28,550
It's like a primitive.

906
00:56:28,550 --> 00:56:31,890
When you do a conditional,
you have to force.

907
00:56:31,890 --> 00:56:32,880
Now, I'm not going to
look at any more

908
00:56:32,880 --> 00:56:34,350
of this in any detail.

909
00:56:34,350 --> 00:56:36,750
It isn't very exciting.

910
00:56:36,750 --> 00:56:38,990
And what's left is how
you make delays.

911
00:56:38,990 --> 00:56:42,680
Well, delays are data structures
which contain an

912
00:56:42,680 --> 00:56:44,840
expression, an environment,
and a type on them.

913
00:56:44,840 --> 00:56:46,680
And it says they're a thunk.

914
00:56:46,680 --> 00:56:50,100
That comes from ALGOL language,
and it's claimed to

915
00:56:50,100 --> 00:56:52,970
be the sound of something
being pushed on a stack.

916
00:56:52,970 --> 00:56:53,410
I don't know.

917
00:56:53,410 --> 00:56:57,830
I was not an ALGOLician or an
ALGOLite or whatever, so I

918
00:56:57,830 --> 00:56:58,740
don't know.

919
00:56:58,740 --> 00:57:00,270
But that's what was claimed.

920
00:57:00,270 --> 00:57:03,400
And undelay is something which
will recursively undelay

921
00:57:03,400 --> 00:57:07,860
thunks until the thunk becomes
something which isn't a thunk.

922
00:57:07,860 --> 00:57:09,930
This is the way you implement
a call by name

923
00:57:09,930 --> 00:57:12,050
like thing in ALGOL.

924
00:57:12,050 --> 00:57:15,210
And that's about all there is.

925
00:57:15,210 --> 00:57:16,460
Are there any questions?

926
00:57:16,460 --> 00:57:26,840


927
00:57:26,840 --> 00:57:27,560
AUDIENCE: Gerry?

928
00:57:27,560 --> 00:57:29,626
PROFESSOR: Yes, Vesko?

929
00:57:29,626 --> 00:57:33,900
AUDIENCE: I noticed you avoided
calling by name in the

930
00:57:33,900 --> 00:57:38,480
primitive procedures,
I was wondering what

931
00:57:38,480 --> 00:57:39,350
cause you have on that?

932
00:57:39,350 --> 00:57:40,070
You never need that?

933
00:57:40,070 --> 00:57:44,720
PROFESSOR: Vesko is asking if
it's ever reasonable to call a

934
00:57:44,720 --> 00:57:47,140
primitive procedure by name?

935
00:57:47,140 --> 00:57:49,270
The answer is, yes.

936
00:57:49,270 --> 00:57:51,680
There's one particular case
where it's reasonable,

937
00:57:51,680 --> 00:57:52,930
actually two.

938
00:57:52,930 --> 00:57:56,050


939
00:57:56,050 --> 00:57:59,250
Construction of a data structure
like cons where

940
00:57:59,250 --> 00:58:01,100
making an array if you
have arrays with

941
00:58:01,100 --> 00:58:03,690
any number of elements.

942
00:58:03,690 --> 00:58:07,440
It's unnecessary to evaluate
those arguments.

943
00:58:07,440 --> 00:58:10,180
All you need is promises to
evaluate those arguments if

944
00:58:10,180 --> 00:58:11,160
you look at them.

945
00:58:11,160 --> 00:58:17,310
If I cons together two things,
then I could cons together the

946
00:58:17,310 --> 00:58:21,830
promises just as easily as I can
cons together the things.

947
00:58:21,830 --> 00:58:23,720
And it's not even when
I CAR CDR them that I

948
00:58:23,720 --> 00:58:24,840
have to look at them.

949
00:58:24,840 --> 00:58:26,150
That just gets out
the promises and

950
00:58:26,150 --> 00:58:28,260
passes them to somebody.

951
00:58:28,260 --> 00:58:31,320
That's why the lambda calculus
definition, the Alonzo Church

952
00:58:31,320 --> 00:58:34,420
definition of CAR, CDR,
and cons makes sense.

953
00:58:34,420 --> 00:58:36,630
It's because no work is done
in CAR, CDR, and cons, it's

954
00:58:36,630 --> 00:58:40,760
just shuffling data, it's just
routing, if you will.

955
00:58:40,760 --> 00:58:42,960
However, the things that do
have to look at data are

956
00:58:42,960 --> 00:58:45,280
things like plus.

957
00:58:45,280 --> 00:58:47,910
Because they have a look at the
bits that the numbers are

958
00:58:47,910 --> 00:58:50,220
made out of, unless they're
lambda calculus

959
00:58:50,220 --> 00:58:52,460
numbers which are funny.

960
00:58:52,460 --> 00:58:54,630
They have to look at the bits
to be able to crunch them

961
00:58:54,630 --> 00:58:55,880
together to do the add.

962
00:58:55,880 --> 00:58:59,210


963
00:58:59,210 --> 00:59:03,280
So, in fact, data constructors,
data selectors,

964
00:59:03,280 --> 00:59:08,500
and, in fact, things that
side-effect data objects don't

965
00:59:08,500 --> 00:59:13,300
need to do any forcing in the
laziest possible interpreters.

966
00:59:13,300 --> 00:59:16,460


967
00:59:16,460 --> 00:59:18,700
On the other hand predicates
on data structures have to.

968
00:59:18,700 --> 00:59:21,710


969
00:59:21,710 --> 00:59:23,560
Is this a pair?

970
00:59:23,560 --> 00:59:24,640
Or is it a symbol?

971
00:59:24,640 --> 00:59:25,690
Well, you better find out.

972
00:59:25,690 --> 00:59:26,940
You got to look at it then.

973
00:59:26,940 --> 00:59:30,300


974
00:59:30,300 --> 00:59:31,550
Any other questions?

975
00:59:31,550 --> 00:59:40,050


976
00:59:40,050 --> 00:59:41,610
Oh, well, I suppose it's
time for a break.

977
00:59:41,610 --> 00:59:42,106
