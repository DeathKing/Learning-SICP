编译
Compilation

6
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:22,650
教授: 上节课 我们学习了
PROFESSOR: Last time, we took a look at

7
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:25,675
一个显式控制的Lisp求值器
an explicit control evaluator for Lisp

8
00:00:25,670 --> 00:00:28,976
它弥合了像Lisp
and that bridged the gap between all these high-level languages

9
00:00:29,056 --> 00:00:32,144
或者查询语言之类的高级语言
like Lisp and query language all that stuff

10
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:36,160
与传统寄存器机器之间的鸿沟
bridged the gap between that and a conventional register machine.

11
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:40,144
事实上 你可以将显式控制求值器
And in fact, you can think of the explicit control evaluator

12
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:44,384
看作是 在一台常见的
either as, say the code for a Lisp interpreter

13
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:45,950
寄存机器上实现的
if you wanted to implement it in the

14
00:00:46,525 --> 00:00:49,500
Lisp求值器的汇编代码
assembly language of some conventional register transfer machine,

15
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:51,504
或者 你可以把它看做是
or, if you like, you can think of it as the microcode

16
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:54,560
某台专门运行Lisp的机器的微程序
of some machine that's going to be specially designed to run Lisp.

17
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:55,925
无论是那种情况
In either case,

18
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:58,688
我们都是把一台
Nwhat we're doing is we're taking a machine

19
00:00:58,944 --> 00:01:00,512
处理低级语言的机器
that speaks some low-level language

20
00:01:01,420 --> 00:01:03,328
抬高到一个层次
and we're raising the machine

21
00:01:03,376 --> 00:01:04,880
以便处理像Lisp这样的高级语言
to a high-level language like Lisp

22
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:06,352
这是通过编写解释器来实现的
by writing an interpreter.

23
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:09,584
来看个例子
So for instance

24
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:13,776
这里 从概念上来说
here, conceptually,

25
00:01:18,016 --> 00:01:19,470
从概念上来说 这是一台
here conceptually is a

26
00:01:20,544 --> 00:01:23,440
专用于计算阶乘的机器
a special purpose machine for computing factorials.

27
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:27,392
输入5 输出120
It takes in five and puts out 120.

28
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:30,832
这个专用机器实际上
And what this special purpose machine is

29
00:01:30,970 --> 00:01:32,720
是一个Lisp解释器
actually a Lisp interpreter

30
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:36,176
它将自己配置为计算阶乘
that's configured itself to run factorials

31
00:01:38,350 --> 00:01:40,992
因为你向它送入了一台阶乘机器的描述
because you feed into it a description of the factorial machine.

32
00:01:42,125 --> 00:01:43,700
这就是解释器
So that's what an interpreter is.

33
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:45,664
它将自己配置为
It configures itself to

34
00:01:46,370 --> 00:01:49,248
模拟你所输入描述的机器
emulate a machine whose description you read in.

35
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:51,936
那么 在Lisp解释器里是什么?
Now, inside the Lisp interpreter, what's that?

36
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:55,440
里面可能是通用的寄存器语言解释器
Well, that might be your general register language interpreter

37
00:01:56,987 --> 00:02:00,180
它将自己配置成像Lisp解释器那样
that configures itself to behave like a Lisp interpreter

38
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:02,032
因为你输入了一系列用寄存器语言
because you put in a whole bunch of instructions

39
00:02:02,128 --> 00:02:03,040
编写的指令
in register language.

40
00:02:03,370 --> 00:02:05,168
这就是显式控制求值器
This is the explicit control evaluator.

41
00:02:07,050 --> 00:02:08,704
它里面也有一些库
And then it also has some sort of library

42
00:02:08,730 --> 00:02:11,088
由基本运算符和Lisp运算
a library of primitive operators and Lisp operations

43
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,288
等等要素组成
all sorts of things like that.

44
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:16,896
这是解释执行的一般策略
That's the general strategy of interpretation.

45
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:18,512
事实上 我们所做的是
And the point is, what we're doing

46
00:02:18,608 --> 00:02:20,140
通过编写解释器
is we're writing an interpreter

47
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:23,408
将机器抬升到
to raise the machine

48
00:02:23,424 --> 00:02:25,240
我们程序所在的层次
to the level of the programs that we want to write.

49
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:26,720
当然 还有另外一种策略
Well, there's another strategy

50
00:02:27,424 --> 00:02:28,896
这种不同的策略就是编译
a different one, which is compilation.

51
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:30,432
编译有一些不同
Compilation's a little bit different.

52
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:31,504
这里
Here--

53
00:02:33,370 --> 00:02:34,752
我们可能已经实现了
here we might have produced

54
00:02:35,679 --> 00:02:38,525
一个特定用途的机器
a special purpose machine for,

55
00:02:38,624 --> 00:02:39,984
用来计算阶乘
for computing factorials

56
00:02:43,625 --> 00:02:46,260
从某种使用寄存器语言的机器开始
starting with some sort of machine that speaks register language

57
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:47,720
但是 我们将让它执行不同的策略
except we're going to do a different strategy.

58
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:50,384
把我们的阶乘程序
We take our factorial program.

59
00:02:51,550 --> 00:02:53,920
作为源代码输入编译器
We use that as the source code into a compiler.

60
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:55,150
编译器就会
What the compiler will do

61
00:02:55,150 --> 00:02:57,625
把这个阶乘程序
is translate that factorial program

62
00:02:57,620 --> 00:02:59,072
翻译成某种寄存器机器语言
into some register machine language.

63
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:03,400
现在它并不是Lisp的显式控制求值器
And this will now be not the explicit control evaluator for Lisp

64
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:06,176
而是某种用来计算阶乘的寄存器语言
this will be some register language for computing factorials.

65
00:03:06,496 --> 00:03:08,368
这就是翻译的过程
So this is the translation of that.

66
00:03:10,544 --> 00:03:12,416
它将进入某种加载器
That will go into some sort of loader

67
00:03:13,350 --> 00:03:15,216
它会把这些代码
which will combine this code

68
00:03:15,312 --> 00:03:16,848
和从程序库中选取的代码
with code selected from the library

69
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:18,656
比如乘法运算等 结合在一起
to do things like primitive multiplication.

70
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:21,696
随后我们将生成一个加载模块
And then we'll produce a load module

71
00:03:22,225 --> 00:03:25,060
它把寄存器语言机器配置成
which configures the register language machine

72
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:27,248
一个专门用来计算阶乘的机器
to be a special purpose factorial machine.

73
00:03:28,125 --> 00:03:30,220
这就是不同的策略
So that's a, that's a different strategy.

74
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:31,225
在解释中
In interpretation,

75
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:32,016
我们把机器
we're raising

76
00:03:32,912 --> 00:03:35,232
抬升到Lisp语言的层次
the machine to the level of our language, like Lisp.

77
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:36,340
而在编译中
In compilation

78
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:38,432
我们将我们的程序下降到
we're taking our program and lowering

79
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:40,560
机器语言的层次
it to the language that's spoken by the machine.

80
00:03:41,968 --> 00:03:43,840
那么 这两个策略有什么区别呢?
Well, how do these two strategies compare?

81
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:49,424
编译器可以生成执行起来更有效率的代码
The compiler can produce code that will execute more efficiently.

82
00:03:52,050 --> 00:03:53,904
主要原因是
The essential reason for that

83
00:03:54,170 --> 00:03:58,896
如果你考虑运行中的寄存器操作
is that if you think about the register operations that are running

84
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:04,496
解释器需要生成寄存器的操作
the interpreter has to produce register operations

85
00:04:04,970 --> 00:04:06,752
从原则上来讲 它需要足够通用
which, in principle, are going to be general enough

86
00:04:07,328 --> 00:04:08,944
以支持任何Lisp过程的执行
to execute any Lisp procedure.

87
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:12,256
而编译器只需要
Whereas the compiler only has to worry about

88
00:04:12,272 --> 00:04:14,920
生成一组特定的寄存器操作
producing a special bunch of register operations for

89
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:18,224
用来执行你所编译的那部分特定的Lisp过程
for doing the particular Lisp procedure that you've compiled.

90
00:04:20,175 --> 00:04:21,200
换一种说法
Or another way to say that

91
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:25,312
解释器是一种通用的模拟器
is that the interpreter is a general purpose simulator

92
00:04:25,925 --> 00:04:27,580
当你输入一个Lisp过程时
that when you read in a Lisp procedure

93
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:31,325
它们就会模拟那个过程所描述的程序
then those can simulate the program described by that, by that procedure.

94
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:33,872
所以解释器旨在成为一个通用模拟器
So the interpreter is worrying about making a general purpose simulator

95
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:35,968
而编译器 实际上
whereas the compiler, in effect,

96
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,680
只需要将东西配置成
is configuring the thing to be the machine

97
00:04:37,712 --> 00:04:39,344
解释器将要去模拟的机器
that the interpreter would have been simulating.

98
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:41,344
所以编译器可以运行得更快
So the compiler can be faster.

99
00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:53,648
另一方面
OK, On the other hand

100
00:04:55,970 --> 00:04:58,288
解释器更适合用来排查错误
the interpreter is a nicer environment for debugging.

101
00:04:59,438 --> 00:05:01,250
这是因为
And the reason for that is that we've got the

102
00:05:01,575 --> 00:05:03,020
我们的源代码实际上就在那里
the source code actually there.

103
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:04,816
我们正在解释它们
We're interpreting it That's what we're working with.

104
00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:07,696
并且库也在其中
And we also have the library around.

105
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:10,896
看 库是解释器的一部分
See, the interpreter--the library sitting there is part of the interpreter.

106
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:13,168
而编译器只会拉取
The compiler only pulls out from the library

107
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:14,560
运行程序所需要的代码
what it needs to run the program.

108
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:17,008
所以 如果你在排查错误的途中
So if you're in the middle of debugging

109
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,720
你想写一些额外的代码
and you might like to write a little extra program

110
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,570
来考察运行过程中的数据类型
to examine some run time data structure

111
00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:24,256
或者做一些
or to produce some computation

112
00:05:24,304 --> 00:05:25,920
在写程序时没有想到的计算
that you didn't think of when you wrote the program

113
00:05:25,952 --> 00:05:27,536
解释器可以完美搞定这些
the interpreter can do that perfectly well

114
00:05:28,050 --> 00:05:29,216
而编译器不行
whereas the compiler can't.

115
00:05:29,625 --> 00:05:31,900
所以它们各有优点
So there are sort of dual, dual advantages.

116
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:34,480
编译器将生成运行更快的代码
The compiler will produce code that executes faster.

117
00:05:34,850 --> 00:05:37,024
而解释器是一种更适合排错的环境
The interpreter is a better environment for debugging.

118
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:41,408
大多数Lisp系统最终将二者都实现了
And most Lisp systems end up having both

119
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:45,232
这样你就可以在开发阶段
end up being configured so you have an interpreter

120
00:05:45,248 --> 00:05:47,080
可以使用解释器
that you use when you're developing your code.

121
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:48,624
随后通过编译加速代码的运行
Then you can speed it up by compiling.

122
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:50,032
并且通常
And very often,

123
00:05:50,048 --> 00:05:51,680
你能够让被编译的代码
you can arrange that compiled code

124
00:05:51,696 --> 00:05:53,568
和被解释的代码互相调用
and interpreted code can call each other.

125
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,336
我们将学习如何做到 其实不难
We'll see how to do that, That's not hard.

126
00:05:59,270 --> 00:05:59,856
好
OK

127
00:06:00,970 --> 00:06:02,096
事实上
In fact, the way we'll--

128
00:06:04,304 --> 00:06:05,750
在我们将要构建的编译器中
in the compiler we're going to make

129
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:07,584
我们实现编译的代码和解释的代码
the way we'll arrange for compiled coding

130
00:06:07,584 --> 00:06:09,456
互相调用的方式是
and interpreted code to call to call each other

131
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:12,064
我们让编译器和解释器使用
is that we'll have the compiler use exactly

132
00:06:12,112 --> 00:06:14,400
使用完全一致的寄存器约定
the same register conventions as the interpreter.

133
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:21,728
编译器的理念
Well, the idea of a compiler

134
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:25,744
与解释器或求值器的理念很像
is very much like the idea of an interpreter or evaluator.

135
00:06:25,870 --> 00:06:26,464
它们是相同的
It's the same thing.

136
00:06:27,050 --> 00:06:29,392
求值器遍历代码
See, the evaluator walks over the code

137
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:32,352
产生一些寄存器操作
and performs some register operations.

138
00:06:33,650 --> 00:06:34,976
就是我们昨天做的事情
That's what we did yesterday.

139
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:40,272
而编译器会读取代码
Well, the compiler essentially would like to walk over the code

140
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:43,008
生成一些进行求值时
and produce the register operations

141
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:44,672
求值器会进行的
that the evaluator would have done

142
00:06:45,232 --> 00:06:46,640
相关寄存器操作
were it evaluating the thing.

143
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:49,952
这就给我们提供了一个模型
And that gives us some model

144
00:06:50,608 --> 00:06:53,776
来实现一个零阶编译器
for how to implement a zeroth-order compiler

145
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:58,320
一个很差劲但是能用的编译器
a very bad compiler but essentially a compiler.

146
00:06:58,320 --> 00:06:59,328
这种模型就是
A model for doing that

147
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:00,592
你用求值器
is you just take the evaluator,

148
00:07:00,688 --> 00:07:01,888
把代码跑一遍
you run it over the code

149
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:06,060
但不去执行实际的操作
but instead of executing the actual operations

150
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:07,152
只是把它们保存下来
you just save them away.

151
00:07:07,550 --> 00:07:08,825
那就是你编译后的代码
And that's your compiled code.

152
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:10,240
让我举个例子
So let me give you an example of that.

153
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:14,144
假设我们要编译
Suppose we're going to compile--

154
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:17,904
编译(F X) 这个表达式
Suppose we want to compile the expression f of x.

155
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:25,968
我们假设
So let's assume that

156
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:28,064
EXP寄存器中保存着(F X)
we've got f of x in the exp register

157
00:07:28,064 --> 00:07:29,552
而ENV寄存器又保存着其它东西
and something in the environment register.

158
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:32,208
想象我们启动了求值器
And now imagine starting up the evaluator.

159
00:07:34,608 --> 00:07:35,712
它读取了表达式
Well, it looks at the expression

160
00:07:35,712 --> 00:07:37,360
判断它是一个应用
and it sees that it's an application.

161
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:41,904
它分支到求值器代码中的一个地方
And it branches to a place in the

162
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:45,152
我们之前见过的叫EV-APPLICATION的地方
in the evaluator code we saw called ev-application.

163
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,128
然后继续处理
And then it begins.

164
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:50,080
恢复运算对象和UNEV
It stores away the operands and unev

165
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:52,448
然后之后它将运算符放在EXP寄存器中
and then it's going to put the operator in exp,

166
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:54,272
递归地对它求值
and it's going to go recursively evaluate it.

167
00:07:54,470 --> 00:07:56,080
这就是我们经历的过程
That's the process that we walk through.

168
00:07:56,670 --> 00:07:57,840
如果你看代码
And if you start looking at the code,

169
00:07:57,872 --> 00:07:59,744
会看到一些寄存器操作
you start seeing some register operations.

170
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:02,300
你会看到将运算对象赋值给UNEV寄存器
You see assign to unev the operands

171
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:03,952
把运算符赋值给EXP
assign to exp the operator,

172
00:08:04,096 --> 00:08:06,208
保存环境、生成新环境 等等
save the environment, generate that, and so on.

173
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:11,936
如果我们来看下这里的投影
Well, if we look on the overhead here

174
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:19,584
我们会看到产生的这些操作
we can see those operations starting to be produced.

175
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:22,528
这是求值器实际要进行的
Here's sort of the first real operation

176
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,800
第一个操作
that the evaluator would have done.

177
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,200
它将运算对象从EXP寄存器里取出来
It pulls the operands out of the exp register

178
00:08:27,470 --> 00:08:28,624
并将它赋值给UNEV
and assigns it to unev.

179
00:08:30,030 --> 00:08:32,272
然后它给EXP寄存器赋了某个值
And then it assigns something to the expression register,

180
00:08:32,304 --> 00:08:33,460
然后保存CONTINUE
and it saves continue

181
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:34,620
保存ENV
and it saves env.

182
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:38,656
我在这里就只是寄存器赋值
And all I'm doing here is writing down the register assignments

183
00:08:39,570 --> 00:08:42,320
这就是求值器求值代码时进行的操作
that the evaluator would have done in executing that code.

184
00:08:42,770 --> 00:08:43,792
我们缩小画面看看
And can zoom out a little bit.

185
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:47,136
总计有19个操作
Altogether, there are about 19 operations there.

186
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:51,648
这些代码
And this is the--this will be the piece of code

187
00:08:52,050 --> 00:08:53,904
对应着
up until the point where

188
00:08:54,752 --> 00:08:57,100
求值器跳转到APPLY-DISPATCH代码之前
the evaluator branches off to apply-dispatch.

189
00:08:57,860 --> 00:08:59,168
事实上 在这个编译器中
And in fact, in this compiler

190
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:01,184
我们不需要再关心APPLY-DISPATCH了
we're not going to worry about apply-dispatch at all.

191
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:02,112
我们有所有东西
We're going to have everything

192
00:09:02,352 --> 00:09:05,040
我们拥有解释后和编译后的所有代码
we're going to have both interpreted code and compiled code.

193
00:09:06,075 --> 00:09:07,611
通常求值过程
Always evaluate procedures,

194
00:09:07,610 --> 00:09:09,856
是由APPLY-DISPATCH处理的
always apply procedures by going to apply-dispatch.

195
00:09:10,270 --> 00:09:12,320
这将让被解释后代码与编译后代码
That will easily allow interpreted code and

196
00:09:12,368 --> 00:09:13,712
很容易互相调用
compiled code to call each other.

197
00:09:18,270 --> 00:09:19,872
从原理上来说 这样做足矣
Well, in principle, that's all we need to do.

198
00:09:21,050 --> 00:09:22,660
只需运行求值器
You just run the evaluator.

199
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:24,500
因而编译器非常像求值器
So the compiler's a lot like the evaluator.

200
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:26,475
你运行它 唯一不同是你把操作存下来
You run it, except it stashes away these operations

201
00:09:26,470 --> 00:09:28,400
而不是实际执行它们
instead of actually executing them.

202
00:09:29,350 --> 00:09:31,392
这其实不完全正确
Well, that's not, that's not quite true. there's

203
00:09:32,910 --> 00:09:34,992
这里面我们撒了个小谎
There's only one little lie in that.

204
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:39,296
你需要关心的是：如果有个谓词
What you have to worry about is if you have a, a predicate.

205
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:42,160
如果你要进行某种测试
If you have some kind of test you want to do

206
00:09:43,450 --> 00:09:46,032
显然 在你编译时
obviously, at the point when you're compiling it

207
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:47,984
你不知道这些分支中
you don't know which branch of these--

208
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:50,144
哪条分支会被执行
of a conditional like this you're going to do.

209
00:09:51,130 --> 00:09:53,920
所以你不能确定求值器将对哪个求值
So you can't say which one the evaluator would have done.

210
00:09:54,909 --> 00:09:57,125
因此在这里就很简单
So all you do there is very simple.

211
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,496
你把两个分支全编译了
You compile both branches.

212
00:09:59,328 --> 00:10:01,296
因此你编译出一个这样的结构
So you compile a structure that looks like this.

213
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,984
它们都会被编译成
That'll compile into something that says,

214
00:10:05,312 --> 00:10:09,152
首先是P的代码
the code, the code for P.

215
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:16,512
它把结果存入VAL寄存器
And it puts its results in, say, the val register.

216
00:10:18,170 --> 00:10:20,640
解释器对谓词求值
So you walk the interpreter over the predicate

217
00:10:21,350 --> 00:10:24,192
并保证结果会放到VAL寄存器中
and make sure that the result would go into the val register.

218
00:10:24,703 --> 00:10:27,220
随后你编译一条指令
And then you compile an instruction that says

219
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:33,792
如果VAL是TRUE
branch if, if val is true

220
00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:38,752
就转到LABEL1这个地方
to a place we'll call label one.

221
00:10:44,970 --> 00:10:47,520
然后我们写下B的代码
Then we, we will put the code for B

222
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:52,320
让解释器对B进行求值
to walk the interpreter--walk the interpreter over B.

223
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:57,216
然后写一句指令
And then go to put in an instruction that says,

224
00:10:57,232 --> 00:10:58,752
用来跳转到下一条指令
go to the next thing, whatever

225
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:04,560
就是它结束之后要去的地方
whatever was supposed to happen after this thing was done.

226
00:11:04,950 --> 00:11:06,096
你放入那个指令
You put in that instruction.

227
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:08,624
这里你写下LABEL1
And here you put label one.

228
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:13,808
这里写A的代码
And here you put the code for A.

229
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:25,856
然后又是跳转到下一条指令
And you put go to next thing.

230
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:32,880
这就是处理条件分支的办法
So that's how you treat a conditional.

231
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:34,656
你生成一小段这样的代码
You generate a little block like that.

232
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:38,128
除此之外
And other than that

233
00:11:38,950 --> 00:11:41,552
这个零阶编译器与求值器一模一样
this zeroth-order compiler is the same as the evaluator.

234
00:11:42,550 --> 00:11:45,120
它只是把指令存起来 而不执行它们
It's just stashing away the instructions instead of executing them.

235
00:11:46,550 --> 00:11:47,600
看起来很简单
That seems pretty simple,

236
00:11:47,648 --> 00:11:49,088
但我们已经取得了某些收获
but we've gained something by that.

237
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:52,624
它会比求值器更有效率
See, already that's going to be more efficient than the evaluator.

238
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:56,144
因为 如果你观察求值器的运行
Because, if you watch the evaluator run

239
00:11:56,350 --> 00:12:01,056
它并不只是进行寄存器操作
it's not only generating the register operations we wrote down

240
00:12:01,270 --> 00:12:03,504
它还会决定执行哪个
it's also doing things to decide which ones to generate.

241
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:07,232
它做的第一件事就是
So the very first thing it does, say here

242
00:12:07,925 --> 00:12:09,775
以它为例 就是进行某些测试
here for instance, is go do some tests

243
00:12:09,770 --> 00:12:11,568
确定它是一个应用
and decide that this is an application

244
00:12:13,570 --> 00:12:15,056
然后就跳转到
and then branch off to the place that,

245
00:12:15,392 --> 00:12:16,624
处理应用的地方去
that handles applications.

246
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:18,448
换句话说 求值器做的事情是
In other words, what the evaluator's doing

247
00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:22,768
分析代码需要进行的运算
is simultaneously analyzing the code to see what to do

248
00:12:23,470 --> 00:12:24,992
同时并执行它们
and running these operations.

249
00:12:25,550 --> 00:12:28,280
当你运行求值器一百万次
And when you-- if you run the evaluator a million times

250
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:30,304
这个分析过程就进行一百万次
that analysis phase happens a million times

251
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:32,580
而在编译器中 它只会进行一次
whereas in the compiler, it's happened once

252
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:34,816
之后就只有寄存器操作了
and then you just have the register operations themselves.

253
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,680
这就是零阶编译器了
Ok, that's a, a zeroth-order compiler

254
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:44,048
但它是个拙劣的编译器
but it is a wretched, wretched compiler.

255
00:12:44,450 --> 00:12:45,280
它挺蠢的
It's really dumb.

256
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:48,416
让我们回过头来
Let's--let's go back and,

257
00:12:49,888 --> 00:12:50,976
看看这张投影
and look at this overhead.

258
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:55,296
看看这个东西做的一些操作
So look at look at some of the operations this thing is doing.

259
00:12:55,850 --> 00:12:56,880
我们想看看
We're supposedly

260
00:12:59,728 --> 00:13:02,288
在解释(F  X)时的操作
looking at the operations in interpreting f of x.

261
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:04,848
这里就是它做了什么
Now, look here what it's doing.

262
00:13:05,170 --> 00:13:06,112
举个例子 这里
For example, here

263
00:13:07,150 --> 00:13:11,984
它将(OPERATOR (FETCH EXP))赋值给EXP
it assigns to exp the operator in fetch of exp.

264
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:15,872
其实没必要这样做
But see, there's no reason to do that, because this is--

265
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:17,472
因为编译器知道
the compiler knows

266
00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:21,840
(OPERATOR (FETCH EXP))的值就是F
that the operator, fetch of exp,  is f right here.

267
00:13:23,350 --> 00:13:25,568
因此这个指令没理由存在
So there's no reason why this instruction should say that.

268
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:28,880
应该改为：要把F赋值给EXP
It should say, we'll assign to exp, f.

269
00:13:29,450 --> 00:13:31,088
或者实际上 你完全不需要EXP
Or in fact, you don't need exp at all.

270
00:13:31,875 --> 00:13:33,560
没有理由需要EXP
There's no reason it should have exp at all.

271
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:35,168
EXP是用来做什么的?
What, what did exp get used for?

272
00:13:35,184 --> 00:13:36,330
我们看这里
Well, if we come down here

273
00:13:40,770 --> 00:13:42,208
我们对VAL赋值
we're going to assign to val

274
00:13:43,050 --> 00:13:47,344
在环境里的EXP里寻找东西
look up the stuff in exp in the environment.

275
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:49,536
因此 我们实际上是要
So what we really should do

276
00:13:49,552 --> 00:13:51,540
替换掉所有的EXP寄存器
get rid of the exp register altogether

277
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:53,328
把这个指令修改为
and just change this instruction to say,

278
00:13:53,344 --> 00:13:54,160
给VAL赋值
assign to val

279
00:13:54,450 --> 00:13:56,064
在环境中查找
look up the variable value

280
00:13:56,368 --> 00:13:58,400
符号F的值
of the symbol f in the environment.

281
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:01,776
类似地
Similarly

282
00:14:02,570 --> 00:14:04,272
回到这里 我们也完全不需要UNEV
back up here, we don't need unev at all

283
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:05,792
因为我们知道
because we know

284
00:14:06,225 --> 00:14:09,160
因为我们知道 (FETCH EXP)取出的运算对象
what the operands of fetch of exp are for this piece of code.

285
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:10,624
就是'(X)
It's the, it's the list x.

286
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:14,064
从某种意义上来说
So in some sense

287
00:14:16,170 --> 00:14:19,392
你完全不需要UNEV和EXP
you don't want unev and exp at all.

288
00:14:19,670 --> 00:14:21,056
看看它们实际上是什么
See, what they really are in some sense,

289
00:14:21,088 --> 00:14:25,300
它们不是实际运行机器的寄存器
those aren't registers of the actual machine that's supposed to run.

290
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:26,400
它们实际上是
Those are registers

291
00:14:26,608 --> 00:14:29,504
为了模拟该机器的而设置的寄存器
that have to do with arranging the thing that can simulate that machine.

292
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:33,776
所以它们保存一些表达式
So they're always going to hold expressions

293
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,048
以编译器的视角看来
which from the compiler's point of view,

294
00:14:36,064 --> 00:14:36,816
它们就是常量
are just constants,

295
00:14:36,950 --> 00:14:38,480
因此可以直接把它们放到代码中
so can be put right into the code.

296
00:14:39,470 --> 00:14:41,344
你可以忘掉那些关于
So you can forget about all the operations

297
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:42,544
EXP和UNEV的操作
worrying about exp and unev

298
00:14:42,576 --> 00:14:43,776
只用那些常量
and just use those constants.

299
00:14:44,025 --> 00:14:48,000
与之相似 如果我们回顾这里
Similarly, again, if we go, go back and look here

300
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,328
有像(ASSIGN CONTINUE EVAL-ARGS)之类的语句
there are things like assign to continue eval-args.

301
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:55,392
现在 它和任何东西都没有关系
Now, that has nothing to do with anything.

302
00:14:55,620 --> 00:14:57,760
它只是求值器
That was just the evaluator

303
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:00,176
维护了下一步需要去哪
keeping track of where it should go next

304
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:05,968
在某些应用中对参数进行求值
to evaluate the arguments in some, in some application.

305
00:15:06,825 --> 00:15:08,650
当然 这与编译器没关系
But of course, that's irrelevant to the compiler,

306
00:15:08,650 --> 00:15:13,888
因为这个分析过程已经被编译器做完了
because you-- the analysis phase will have already done that.

307
00:15:15,050 --> 00:15:16,832
所以编译后的代码完全不需要它
So this is completely irrelevant.

308
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:19,328
因此许多向CONTINUE寄存器
So a lot of these, these assignments

309
00:15:19,328 --> 00:15:21,300
赋值的操作都是无用的
to continue have not to do

310
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:24,624
运行着的机器留着它们
where the running machine is supposed to continue

311
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:25,776
是为了跟踪它的状态
in keeping track of its state.

312
00:15:26,075 --> 00:15:28,725
是为了知道求值器的下一步分析
It has to, to do with where the evaluator analysis should continue

313
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,032
而它们是完全无关的
and those are completely irrelevant.

314
00:15:30,064 --> 00:15:31,232
因此我们可以去掉它们
So we can get rid of them.

315
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:45,984
那么 如果我们简单地
Ok, well, if we, if we simply do that,

316
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:47,750
进行这类优化
make those kinds of optimizations

317
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:51,648
不再考虑EXP和UNEV
get rid, get rid of worrying about exp and unev

318
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:56,224
去掉这些无关的寄存器赋值
and get rid of these irrelevant register assignments to continue

319
00:15:57,250 --> 00:15:59,968
我们就可以找到这些代码
then we can take this literal code

320
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:06,208
也就是求值器会执行的这19条指令
these sort of 19 instructions that the evaluator would have done

321
00:16:06,912 --> 00:16:08,128
给替换掉
and then replace them.

322
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:10,336
请看幻灯片
Let's look at the, at the slide.

323
00:16:12,270 --> 00:16:15,344
我们去掉了大概一半
Replace them by--we get rid of about half of them.

324
00:16:18,288 --> 00:16:20,752
同样 这就是某种过滤
And again, this is just sort of filtering

325
00:16:21,070 --> 00:16:24,464
把无关的东西去掉
what the evaluator would have done by getting rid of the irrelevant stuff.

326
00:16:25,170 --> 00:16:26,224
你们看 比如说
And you see, for instance

327
00:16:27,470 --> 00:16:29,664
这里 求值器说
here the--where the evaluator said,

328
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:32,432
(ASSIGN VAL (LOOKUP 'F (FETCH ENV)))
assign val, look up variable value, fetch of exp

329
00:16:32,464 --> 00:16:34,224
这里 我们放入了一个常量F
here we have put in the constant f.

330
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:37,024
这里又放了一个常量X
Here we've put in the constant x.

331
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:42,416
因此 这个编译器又稍微好一点
So there's a, there's a little better compiler.

332
00:16:43,790 --> 00:16:46,768
但它还是比较蠢
It's still pretty dumb.

333
00:16:47,950 --> 00:16:49,584
它仍会做很多蠢事
It's still doing a lot of dumb things.

334
00:16:50,450 --> 00:16:52,528
我们再看幻灯片
Again, if we go look at the slide again

335
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:53,936
看最开头的地方
look at the very beginning here

336
00:16:56,340 --> 00:16:58,176
我们调用(SAVE ENV)保存环境
we see a save the environment

337
00:16:59,350 --> 00:17:01,728
然后给VAL寄存器赋某个值
assign something to the val register

338
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:03,350
然后恢复环境
and restore the environment.

339
00:17:03,350 --> 00:17:04,416
它是从哪来的
Where'd that come from?

340
00:17:04,910 --> 00:17:07,104
它来自求值器的这个地方
That came from the evaluator back here saying

341
00:17:07,152 --> 00:17:10,288
哦 我在正在对一个应用求值
oh, I'm in the middle of evaluating an application.

342
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:14,688
因此我要递归调用EVAL-DISPATCH
So I'm going to recursively call eval dispatch.

343
00:17:15,872 --> 00:17:17,984
我最好把接下来要用到的东西
So I'd better save the thing I'm going to need later,

344
00:17:17,984 --> 00:17:19,088
保存到环境中
which is the environment.

345
00:17:19,770 --> 00:17:22,864
这就是递归调用EVAL-DISPATCH的结果
This was the result of recursively calling eval dispatch.

346
00:17:23,472 --> 00:17:25,776
刚才那个例子就是对符号F求值的结果
It was evaluating the symbol f in that case.

347
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:28,272
从EVAL-DISPATCH中返回
Then it came back from eval dispatch,

348
00:17:28,288 --> 00:17:29,664
将环境恢复
restored the environment.

349
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:32,288
但是实际上
But in fact,

350
00:17:32,590 --> 00:17:35,888
这个求值过程中 所进行的操作
the actual thing it ended up doing in the evaluation

351
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:37,712
完全不会影响环境
is not going to hurt the environment at all.

352
00:17:38,670 --> 00:17:40,800
所以这里没必要先保存环境
So there's no reason to be saving the environment

353
00:17:40,848 --> 00:17:42,220
再恢复环境
and restoring the environment here.

354
00:17:45,670 --> 00:17:46,624
与之类似
Similarly

355
00:17:49,792 --> 00:17:51,392
这里 我们保存了参数表
here I'm saving the argument list.

356
00:17:53,070 --> 00:17:55,808
那是一个求值参数的循环
That's a piece of the argument evaluation loop,

357
00:17:55,824 --> 00:17:56,864
先保存参数表
saving the argument list

358
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,032
然后在这里恢复
and here you restore it.

359
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:00,512
但事实上最后
But the actual thing that you ended up doing

360
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:02,288
并没有变更参数表
didn't trash the argument list.

361
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:04,176
所以不需要保存它
So there was no reason to save it.

362
00:18:08,650 --> 00:18:12,880
换种方式来说
So another way to say, another way to say that

363
00:18:13,770 --> 00:18:14,800
怎么说呢
is that the,

364
00:18:16,432 --> 00:18:19,136
求值器需要最大限度地保持悲观
the evaluator has to be maximally pessimistic

365
00:18:19,870 --> 00:18:21,072
因为 从它的视角来看
because as far from its point of view

366
00:18:21,088 --> 00:18:23,060
只知道接下来是要对某些东西进行求值
it's just going off to evaluate something.

367
00:18:23,248 --> 00:18:24,976
所以最好把稍后要用的都存下来
So it better save what it's going to need later.

368
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:27,792
一旦你完成了分析
But once you've done the analysis,

369
00:18:27,824 --> 00:18:29,680
从编译器的角度就会考虑
the compiler is in a position to say

370
00:18:29,728 --> 00:18:31,472
哪些是我真正需要存下来的?
well, what actually did I need to save?

371
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:33,312
我们需要去 --
And doesn't need to do any--

372
00:18:33,424 --> 00:18:37,300
它不需要像求值器一样小心翼翼
it doesn't need to be as careful as the evaluator

373
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:38,800
因为它知道 实际需要什么
because it knows what it actually needs

374
00:18:39,690 --> 00:18:41,168
无论如何 如果我们完成了优化
Well, in any case, if we do that

375
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:45,712
消除掉所有多余的保存和恢复
and eliminate all those redundant saves and restores

376
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:49,056
那么我们可以得到这样的结果
then we can get it down to this.

377
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:51,536
我们可以发现
And you see there are actually only three

378
00:18:51,648 --> 00:18:53,712
只有三条指令是必须的
only three instructions that we actually need

379
00:18:54,070 --> 00:18:55,728
从刚才的11条指令优化成这样
down from the initial 11 or so

380
00:18:55,970 --> 00:18:58,816
或是从原始的20条指令优化而来
or the initial 20 or so in the original one.

381
00:18:59,870 --> 00:19:00,928
这告诉我们
And that's just saying,

382
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:03,184
对于这些寄存器操作
of those register operations

383
00:19:03,270 --> 00:19:04,944
哪些是必需的?
which ones did we actually need?

384
00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:11,744
让我换个方式来总结一下
Let me just sort of summarize that in another way,

385
00:19:11,744 --> 00:19:13,488
我先给你们看一张图
just to show you in a little better picture.

386
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,520
这张图片
Here's a picture of starting--

387
00:19:18,770 --> 00:19:20,816
展示了所有的保存和恢复
This is looking at all the saves and restores.

388
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:25,232
这里是表达式(F X)
So here's the expression, f of x

389
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:27,872
在下面这里
and then this traces through, on the bottom here

390
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:31,808
是对求值器中各种地方的跟踪
the various places in the evaluator

391
00:19:34,975 --> 00:19:38,040
在求值发生时会使用这些地方
that were passed when the evaluation happened.

392
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:40,016
在这里 你可以看到箭头
And then here, here you see arrows.

393
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:42,080
下箭头代表寄存器的保存
Arrow down means register saved.

394
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,848
所以最先保存的是ENV寄存器
So the first thing that happened is the environment got saved.

395
00:19:46,820 --> 00:19:48,688
然后 在这里恢复ENV
And over here, the environment got restored.

396
00:19:52,384 --> 00:19:54,540
这些都是成对的栈操作
so there are all the pairs of stack operations.

397
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:57,568
如果你更进一步
Now, if you go ahead and say

398
00:19:58,125 --> 00:20:00,780
我们记得
well, let's remember that we don't--that unev

399
00:20:00,896 --> 00:20:03,024
UNEV是个完全没用的寄存器
for instance, is a completely useless register.

400
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:09,780
如果我们用固定结构的代码
And if we use the constant structure of the code

401
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:12,528
就不需要保存UNEV 因为完全用不上
well, we don't need, we don't need to save unev.

402
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:19,152
然后 根据我们约定的
And then, depending on how we set up the discipline of the--

403
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:21,888
应用过程的准则
of calling other things that apply,

404
00:20:21,888 --> 00:20:23,850
我们会选择是否保存CONTINUE
we may or may not need to save continue.

405
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:28,740
这就是我们做的第一件事
That's the first step I did.

406
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:30,512
然后我们可以看看
And then we can look and see what's actually,

407
00:20:31,712 --> 00:20:32,704
实际需要些什么
what's actually needed.

408
00:20:33,070 --> 00:20:35,568
其实在求值F的过程中
See, we don't-- didn't really need to save env

409
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:37,824
我们不需要保存ENV
across-evaluating f

410
00:20:38,088 --> 00:20:39,920
因为它不会被破坏
because it wouldn't, it wouldn't trash it.

411
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:41,312
因此 如果我们利用这点
So if we take advantage of that

412
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:47,568
这里对F的求值
and see the evaluation of f here

413
00:20:48,570 --> 00:20:50,448
完全不需要担心
doesn't really need to worry about,

414
00:20:51,616 --> 00:20:52,600
会破坏ENV
about hurting env.

415
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:54,944
类似地 这里对X的求值
And similarly, the evaluation of x here

416
00:20:57,170 --> 00:20:58,896
当求值器进行求值时 它会说
when the evaluator did that it said

417
00:20:58,912 --> 00:21:01,648
我最好保存好与之有关的FUN寄存器
Oh, I'd better preserve the function register around that

418
00:21:02,072 --> 00:21:03,220
因为后面也许会用得着
because I might need it later.

419
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:04,896
我最好也保存参数表
And I better preserve the argument list.

420
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:09,056
然而 在这如果是编译器的话
Whereas the compiler is now in a position to know

421
00:21:09,050 --> 00:21:10,384
实际需要哪些寄存器
well, we didn't really need to save--

422
00:21:10,528 --> 00:21:11,840
从而进行相关的保存与恢复
to do those saves and restores.

423
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:16,096
事实上 这里求值器做的所有栈操作
So in fact, all of the stack operations done by the evaluator

424
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:19,584
都证明是过于悲观而不必要
turned out to be unnecessary or overly pessimistic.

425
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:21,456
而编译器在这里是知道这一点的
And the compiler is in a position to know that.

426
00:21:27,350 --> 00:21:28,480
这是最基础的想法
Well that's the basic idea.

427
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:31,000
我们把求值器
We take the evaluator

428
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,240
剔除那些不需要的东西
we eliminate the things that you don't need

429
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:35,240
去除那些对于编译器完全无用的东西
that in some sense have nothing to do with the compiler at all

430
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:36,192
只保留求值的部分
just the evaluator

431
00:21:37,408 --> 00:21:40,400
然后你可以看到哪些栈操作是不必要的
and then you see which stack operations are unnecessary.

432
00:21:40,820 --> 00:21:43,760
这就是书中所描述的编译器
That's the basic structure of the compiler that's

433
00:21:43,856 --> 00:21:45,040
的基本结构
that's described in the book.

434
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:47,008
我给你们展示一下这
Let me just show you how a

435
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:49,680
这个简单的例子
that examples a little bit too simple.

436
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:53,264
为了说清楚 多余的东西是怎样保存的
To see how you, how you actually save a lot

437
00:21:53,296 --> 00:21:56,064
我们来看一个稍复杂的表达式
let's look at a little bit more complicated expression.

438
00:21:58,150 --> 00:22:01,936
(F (G X) 1)
(F (G X) 1)

439
00:22:03,870 --> 00:22:05,520
我们不会讲解所有的代码
And I'm not going to go through all the code.

440
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:08,560
因为代码有点多
There's a, there's a fair pile of it.

441
00:22:09,725 --> 00:22:12,350
我认为在求值器在处理它时
I think there are, there are something like 16

442
00:22:12,350 --> 00:22:14,672
大概会产生
16 pairs of register saves and restores

443
00:22:14,704 --> 00:22:16,256
16对保存-恢复操作
as the evaluator walks through that.

444
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,576
这有一张图表
Here's a diagram of them.

445
00:22:20,570 --> 00:22:21,952
演示了其中的过程
Let's see. You see what's going on.

446
00:22:22,970 --> 00:22:23,904
你从这里开始--
You start out by--

447
00:22:24,250 --> 00:22:26,624
求值器说：“我要求值一个应用”
the evaluator says, oh, I'm about to do an application.

448
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:29,136
在这里保存ENV 又在这里恢复
I'll preserve the environment. I'll restore it here.

449
00:22:30,650 --> 00:22:34,448
然后处理第一个运算对象
Then I'm about to do the first operand.

450
00:22:36,816 --> 00:22:39,280
这是求值器的递归调用
Here it recursively goes to the evaluator.

451
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:40,896
求值器发现 这是一个应用
The evaluator says, oh, this is an application,

452
00:22:40,912 --> 00:22:42,100
又会保存环境
I'll save the environment

453
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:44,976
求值组合式的运算符 然后在这里恢复环境
do the operator of that combination, restore it here.

454
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:48,928
这个恢复匹配的是这个保存操作
This save--this restore matches that save.

455
00:22:49,770 --> 00:22:50,784
以此类推
And so on.

456
00:22:51,650 --> 00:22:52,512
这里的UNEV
There's unev here,

457
00:22:52,528 --> 00:22:54,620
完全没有必要存在
which turns out to be completely unnecessary

458
00:22:54,970 --> 00:22:56,608
CONTINUE寄存器不断地被保存-恢复
continues getting bumped around here.

459
00:22:57,420 --> 00:23:00,416
而FUN寄存器则是在
The function register is getting, getting saved

460
00:23:00,784 --> 00:23:04,368
处理运算对象期间被保存
across the first operands, across the operands.

461
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:06,528
这类的事情一直在发生
All sorts of things are going on.

462
00:23:06,782 --> 00:23:09,390
但如果你问 跟求值器相比
But if you say, well, what of those really were the business of

463
00:23:09,872 --> 00:23:11,664
编译器究竟要做什么？
the compiler as opposed to the evaluator

464
00:23:12,270 --> 00:23:13,552
你会去掉一大堆东西
you get rid of a whole bunch.

465
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:16,640
在这个的基础上 如果你说
And then on top of that, if you say things like

466
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:22,544
对F的求值不会修改ENV寄存器
the evaluation of F doesn't hurt the environment register,

467
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:26,512
或者对符号X的查找
or simply looking up the symbol X,

468
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:32,096
不需要特别保护FUN寄存器
you don't have to protect the function register against that.

469
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:37,600
就得到了只有几对的保存-恢复操作
So you come down to just a couple of, a couple of pairs here.

470
00:23:40,250 --> 00:23:42,275
然而 你还可以再优化一下
And still, you can do a little better.

471
00:23:42,275 --> 00:23:44,330
看看这里的ENV寄存器发生了什么
Look what's going on here with the environment register.

472
00:23:45,210 --> 00:23:47,392
我们观察ENV寄存器的操作 发现
The environment register comes along and says, oh,

473
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,256
这是一个组合式
here's a combination.

474
00:23:54,336 --> 00:23:55,696
而这个求值器
This evaluator, by the way,

475
00:23:55,780 --> 00:23:57,270
对G一无所知
doesn't know anything about G.

476
00:23:58,570 --> 00:24:00,736
所以在这 它说
So here it says, so it says,

477
00:24:01,296 --> 00:24:03,456
我最好保存ENV寄存器
I'd better save the environment register,

478
00:24:03,968 --> 00:24:05,424
因为对G的求值
because evaluating G might be

479
00:24:05,424 --> 00:24:07,424
可能会修改ENV寄存器的值
some arbitrary piece of code that would trash it

480
00:24:07,550 --> 00:24:09,456
而我稍后可能会需要它
and I'm going to need it later,

481
00:24:10,176 --> 00:24:11,408
在这个参数之后
after this argument,

482
00:24:12,224 --> 00:24:13,376
在处理第二个参数的时候
for doing the second argument.

483
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:17,248
这就是为什么它没被优化掉
So that's why this one didn't go away,

484
00:24:19,075 --> 00:24:22,540
因为编译器没有对G将要做的事情做任何假设
because the compiler made no assumptions about what G would do.

485
00:24:22,540 --> 00:24:23,600
另一方面
On the other hand,

486
00:24:24,610 --> 00:24:26,528
如果你看看这里的第二个参数
if you look at what the second argument is,

487
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:27,700
它只是查找“1”这个常量
that's just looking up one.

488
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:29,600
这不需要ENV寄存器
That doesn't need this environment register.

489
00:24:30,770 --> 00:24:32,048
因此没必要保存它
So there's no reason to save it.

490
00:24:32,064 --> 00:24:33,776
事实上 你也可以把这个也去掉
So in fact, you can get rid of that one, too.

491
00:24:34,850 --> 00:24:37,810
这一堆寄存器操作
And from this whole pile of, of register operations,

492
00:24:37,984 --> 00:24:40,080
如果你像这样简单地推理的话
if you simply do a little bit of reasoning like that,

493
00:24:40,550 --> 00:24:43,056
只会剩下两对保存-恢复操作
you get down to, I think, just two pairs of saves and restores.

494
00:24:45,104 --> 00:24:46,976
而这些 如果你知道关于G的某些信息的话
And those, in fact, could go away further if you,

495
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:49,088
可以进一步优化
if you knew something about G.

496
00:24:56,270 --> 00:24:57,856
基本的理念是
So again, the general idea

497
00:24:57,950 --> 00:24:59,980
编译器之所以更好
is that the reason the compiler can be better

498
00:24:59,980 --> 00:25:02,560
是因为解释器对于将要处理的东西一无所知
is that the interpreter doesn't know what it's about to encounter.

499
00:25:03,250 --> 00:25:05,040
它不得不以最悲观的方式保存东西
It has to be maximally pessimistic

500
00:25:05,056 --> 00:25:06,704
来保护它自己
to protect itself.

501
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:08,768
而编译器
The compiler

502
00:25:09,488 --> 00:25:12,384
只需要保存实际需要的东西
only has to deal with what actually had to be saved.

503
00:25:13,370 --> 00:25:15,200
某个东西是否需要保存
And there are two reasons that something

504
00:25:15,248 --> 00:25:17,370
有两种原因
might not have to be saved.

505
00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:18,700
一种是
One is that

506
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:19,824
你保护的东西
what you're protecting it against,

507
00:25:19,952 --> 00:25:21,440
不会修改寄存器
in fact, didn't trash the register,

508
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:23,584
例如 变量查找
like it was just a variable look-up.

509
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:25,200
另一种原因是
And the other one is,

510
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:27,104
你所保存的东西
that the thing that you were saving it for

511
00:25:28,288 --> 00:25:29,920
最后并不会被用到
might turn out not to actually need it.

512
00:25:30,810 --> 00:25:34,272
因此 编译器正是利用了
So those are the two basic pieces of knowledge

513
00:25:34,304 --> 00:25:35,880
这两条基本原则
that the compiler can take advantage of

514
00:25:36,272 --> 00:25:37,760
来让代码变得更高效的
in making the code more efficient.

515
00:25:44,270 --> 00:25:45,328
有什么问题吗？
Let's break for questions.

516
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:53,100
学生: 你一直在说UNEV寄存器
AUDIENCE: You kept saying that the uneval register,

517
00:25:53,130 --> 00:25:56,400
UNEV寄存器完全不会被用到
unev register didn't need to be used at all.

518
00:25:56,416 --> 00:25:58,688
是否意味着 机器只需要6个寄存器足矣？
Does that mean that you could just map a six-register machine?

519
00:25:58,700 --> 00:26:00,080
或者是说 在这个特定的例子里
Or is that, in this particular example,

520
00:26:00,112 --> 00:26:01,180
它没有被用到？
it didn't need to be used?

521
00:26:01,725 --> 00:26:02,810
教授: 对于编译器
PROFESSOR: For the compiler,

522
00:26:04,310 --> 00:26:07,424
你可以生成6个或5个寄存器的代码
you could generate code for the six-register, five, right?

523
00:26:07,568 --> 00:26:09,024
因为EXP寄存器也没有用到
Because that exp goes away also.

524
00:26:09,408 --> 00:26:14,570
是的 你可以把EXP和UNEV都去掉
Assuming--yeah, you can get rid of both exp and unev

525
00:26:14,575 --> 00:26:16,875
因为这些是求值器的数据结构
because, see, those are data structures of the evaluator.

526
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:19,360
以编译器的视角来看
Those are all things that would be constants

527
00:26:19,392 --> 00:26:20,870
这些东西都是常量
from the point of view of the compiler.

528
00:26:21,650 --> 00:26:22,448
关键在于
The only thing is

529
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:24,592
这个特定编译器是被构造出来的
this particular compiler is set up

530
00:26:24,790 --> 00:26:27,920
因此被解释的代码和被编译的代码可以共存
so that interpreted code and compiled code can coexist.

531
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:30,720
可以这样看待它
So the way to think about it is,

532
00:26:30,970 --> 00:26:32,290
你构建了一个芯片
is maybe you build a chip

533
00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:35,500
它就是求值器
which is the evaluator,

534
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:37,280
而编译器可以做的就是
and what the compiler might do

535
00:26:37,312 --> 00:26:39,024
为这个芯片生成代码
is generate code for that chip.

536
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:41,904
只是它不会用到两个寄存器而已
It just wouldn't use two of the registers.

537
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:52,470
好 休息一会
All right, let's take a break.

编译
Compilation

543
00:27:29,216 --> 00:27:32,432
我们刚才研究了编译器应该要做什么
We just looked at what the compiler is supposed to do.

544
00:27:32,780 --> 00:27:36,048
现在我们来简略地看看
Now let's very briefly look at how,

545
00:27:36,150 --> 00:27:37,472
这些目标如何达成
how this gets accomplished.

546
00:27:38,260 --> 00:27:39,584
而我不会给出细节
And I'm going to give no details.

547
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:42,176
在书中有一大堆代码
There's, there's a giant pile of code in the book

548
00:27:42,224 --> 00:27:43,420
展示了所有细节
that gives all the details.

549
00:27:43,456 --> 00:27:45,310
我要做的 是给你们展示
But what I want to do is just show you the,

550
00:27:45,968 --> 00:27:47,264
其中的关键思想
the essential idea here.

551
00:27:49,490 --> 00:27:51,360
换个时间再来关心细节
Worry about the details some other time.

552
00:27:51,510 --> 00:27:55,300
设想我们正在编译一条表达式
Let's imagine that we're compiling an expression

553
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:57,010
这里有一些运算符
that looks like there's some operator

554
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:58,560
和两个参数
and there are two arguments.

555
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:04,240
现在
Now, the--

556
00:28:06,275 --> 00:28:08,140
这个编译器会生成什么代码?
what's the code that the compiler should generate?

557
00:28:08,850 --> 00:28:09,780
首先
Well, first of all,

558
00:28:09,830 --> 00:28:11,200
它会递归运行
it should recursively go off

559
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:13,280
编译运算符
and compile the operator.

560
00:28:14,370 --> 00:28:19,024
它说 我要编译运算符
So it says, I'll compile the operator.

561
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:24,544
最后我需要让它们的结果
And where I'm going to need that

562
00:28:24,848 --> 00:28:27,950
存放在FUN寄存器中
is to be in the function register, eventually.

563
00:28:28,420 --> 00:28:29,600
所以我编译一些指令
So I'll compile some instructions

564
00:28:29,648 --> 00:28:31,568
它们会编译运算符
that will compile the operator

565
00:28:31,690 --> 00:28:38,624
最后把结果放在FUN寄存器中
and end up with the result in the function register.

566
00:28:45,510 --> 00:28:46,940
接下来我要做的是
The next thing it's going to do,

567
00:28:47,710 --> 00:28:49,680
另一个代码片段则说
another piece is to say,

568
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:55,175
我要编译第一个参数
I have to compile the first argument.

569
00:28:55,170 --> 00:28:56,800
因此它递归调地用自己
So it calls itself recursively.

570
00:28:58,040 --> 00:29:03,360
而结果会被放在VAL中
And let's say the result will go into val.

571
00:29:09,070 --> 00:29:10,750
接下来需要做的是
And then what it's going to need to do is

572
00:29:10,750 --> 00:29:12,260
建立起参数表
start setting up the argument list.

573
00:29:12,950 --> 00:29:25,504
(ASSIGN ARGL (CONS (FETCH --
So it'll say, assign to argl cons of fetch--

574
00:29:25,552 --> 00:29:27,104
它会生成这些代码
so it generates this literal instruction--

575
00:29:27,504 --> 00:29:32,512
(FETCH VAL) '()))
fetch of val onto empty list.

576
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,050
然而
However,

577
00:29:37,990 --> 00:29:40,610
当它到这里时
it might have to work--  when it gets here,

578
00:29:41,325 --> 00:29:42,820
它可能需要环境
it's going to need the environment.

579
00:29:43,950 --> 00:29:45,296
它需要环境
It's going to need whatever environment was here

580
00:29:45,328 --> 00:29:48,210
这是求值第一个参数所需要的
in order to do this evaluation of the first argument.

581
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:51,184
因此 它需要保证
So it has to ensure that

582
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:53,760
对运算对象的编译
the compilation of this operand,

583
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:57,850
或者说它需要保护FUN寄存器
or it has to protect the function register

584
00:29:58,016 --> 00:30:00,980
来应对编译运算对象时发生的各种情况
against whatever might happen in the compilation of this operand.

585
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:03,080
因此它在这做了个标注说
So it puts a note here and says, oh,

586
00:30:03,370 --> 00:30:12,896
这个片段需要保护ENV寄存器
this piece should be done preserving the environment register.

587
00:30:17,390 --> 00:30:18,448
与之类似 这里
Similarly, here,

588
00:30:21,024 --> 00:30:23,300
在完成第一个运算对象的编译后
after it gets done compiling the first operand,

589
00:30:23,570 --> 00:30:24,672
它会说 我最好--
it's going to say, I'd better--

590
00:30:24,710 --> 00:30:27,925
我需要知道第二个运算对象的环境
I'm going to need to know the environment for the second operand.

591
00:30:27,925 --> 00:30:29,460
所以它在这做了个标注
So it puts a little note here, saying,

592
00:30:29,710 --> 00:30:35,968
这里也需要保护ENV
yeah, this is also done preserving env.

593
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:41,020
现在它继续运行
Now it goes on and says, well,

594
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:42,832
下一段代码
the next chunk of code

595
00:30:43,312 --> 00:30:49,744
是要编译第二个参数
is the one that's going to compile the second argument.

596
00:30:50,820 --> 00:30:52,640
它将会
And let's say

597
00:30:52,992 --> 00:30:59,280
把编译的结果按约定放入到VAL中
And let's say it'll compile it with a targeted to val, as they say.

598
00:31:03,860 --> 00:31:06,704
随后它会生成一条指令
And then it'll generate the literal instruction,

599
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:09,250
从而建立起参数表
building up the argument list.

600
00:31:09,550 --> 00:31:15,280
(ASSIGN ARGL
So it'll say, assign to argl

601
00:31:20,224 --> 00:31:28,944
(CONS (FETCH VAL) (FETCH ARGL))
cons of the new value it just got onto the old argument list.

602
00:31:33,970 --> 00:31:34,640
然而
However,

603
00:31:34,810 --> 00:31:36,580
为了取得旧的参数表
in order to have the old argument list,

604
00:31:37,150 --> 00:31:40,992
它最好保证这期间发生的任何事情
it better have arranged that the argument list didn't get trashed

605
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:42,690
都不影响旧的参数表
by whatever happened in here.

606
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:45,170
因此它在这做了个标注说
So it puts a little note here and says,

607
00:31:45,344 --> 00:31:51,648
哦 这里需要保护ARGL
oh, this has to be done preserving argl.

608
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:56,030
现在参数表就建立好了
Now it's got the argument list set up.

609
00:31:58,016 --> 00:32:02,864
现在可以准备去APPLY-DISPATCH了
And it's all ready to go to apply dispatch.

610
00:32:07,020 --> 00:32:10,800
它生成了这条指令
It generates this literal instruction.

611
00:32:15,190 --> 00:32:17,370
因为现在参数都在ARGL中
Because now it's got the arguments in argl

612
00:32:18,150 --> 00:32:20,590
运算符在FUN中
and the operator in fun,

613
00:32:20,590 --> 00:32:22,890
如果只是单纯地把运算符放到FUN寄存器中
but wait, it's only got the operator in fun

614
00:32:23,270 --> 00:32:26,640
就需要它保证这块代码
if it had ensured that this block of code

615
00:32:27,096 --> 00:32:29,270
不会破坏FUN寄存器里的东西
didn't trash what was in the function register.

616
00:32:29,670 --> 00:32:31,248
所以它在这做了个标注说
So it puts a little note here and says,

617
00:32:31,550 --> 00:32:32,736
这里的所有东西
oh, yes, all this stuff here

618
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:40,736
最好能够在保护FUN寄存器的情况下完成
had better be done preserving the function register.

619
00:32:43,710 --> 00:32:46,150
所以这就是--
So that's the little--so when it starts ticking--

620
00:32:46,150 --> 00:32:47,104
基本上来说
so basically, what the

621
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:50,240
编译器所做的就是
what the compiler does is

622
00:32:50,544 --> 00:32:52,460
追加一大堆的代码
append a whole bunch of code sequences.

623
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:58,832
而这些代码之中都是一些基本运算
See, what it's got in it is little primitive pieces of things

624
00:32:58,864 --> 00:33:00,128
比如符号查找
like how to look up a symbol,

625
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:02,608
条件分支的处理
how to do a conditional.

626
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:05,440
都是一些琐碎的事情
Those are all little pieces of things.

627
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:07,990
然后按照这种准则将它们追加到一起
And then it appends them together in this sort of discipline.

628
00:33:08,780 --> 00:33:10,790
因此 组合的基本手段就是
So the basic means of combining things

629
00:33:10,864 --> 00:33:13,184
将一段代码追加到另一段的后面
is to append two code sequences.

630
00:33:21,550 --> 00:33:22,864
就是这里发生的事情
That's what's going on here.

631
00:33:25,580 --> 00:33:27,240
这有点取巧
And it's a little bit tricky.

632
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:30,370
向一段代码后面追加代码的思路是
The idea is that it appends two code sequences,

633
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:33,760
小心保护寄存器
taking care to preserve a register.

634
00:33:35,630 --> 00:33:37,930
追加操作看起来像这样
So the actual append operation looks like this.

635
00:33:39,150 --> 00:33:40,656
它要做的是
What it wants to do is say, if--

636
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:44,110
代码的追加是这么来做的
here's what it means to append two code sequences.

637
00:33:44,530 --> 00:33:53,632
如果SEQ1需要寄存器--
So if sequence one needs register--

638
00:33:53,664 --> 00:33:54,720
我应该改一下这个
I should change this.

639
00:33:54,725 --> 00:33:56,870
在SEQ1后面追加SEQ2
Append sequence one to sequence two,

640
00:33:57,420 --> 00:34:03,968
并保护一些寄存器
preserving some register.

641
00:34:08,525 --> 00:34:09,910
这里改成AND
Let me say, and.

642
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:13,030
这样的话前后顺序就清楚了
So it's clear that sequence one comes first.

643
00:34:13,888 --> 00:34:19,870
如果SEQ2需要寄存器
So if sequence two needs the register

644
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:27,856
而SEQ1又修改了寄存器
and sequence one modifies the register,

645
00:34:33,680 --> 00:34:36,304
那么编译器生成的指令是
then the instructions that the compiler spits out,

646
00:34:36,976 --> 00:34:41,344
保存寄存器
are save the register.

647
00:34:43,025 --> 00:34:44,190
这就是代码
Here's the code.

648
00:34:44,350 --> 00:34:45,350
生成这段代码
You generate this code.

649
00:34:45,350 --> 00:34:46,288
保存寄存器
Save the register,

650
00:34:46,725 --> 00:34:52,975
然后写下递归编译SEQ1的结果
and then you put out the recursively compiled stuff for sequence one.

651
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:54,848
然后恢复寄存器
And then you restore the register.

652
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:03,920
再写下递归编译
And then you put out the recursively compiled stuff

653
00:35:04,464 --> 00:35:05,472
SEQ2的结果
for sequence two.

654
00:35:07,075 --> 00:35:09,625
这就是你需要做的
That's in the case where you need to do it.

655
00:35:09,625 --> 00:35:11,820
实际上SEQ2需要寄存器
Sequence two actually needs the register,

656
00:35:11,820 --> 00:35:13,744
而SEQ1改动了它
and sequence one actually clobbers it.

657
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:17,072
否则的话
So that's sort of if. Otherwise,

658
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:26,576
得到的就是SEQ1后面跟着SEQ2
all you spit out is sequence one followed by sequence two.

659
00:35:28,170 --> 00:35:30,304
这就是把两个代码片段
So that's the basic operation

660
00:35:30,592 --> 00:35:33,520
连接到一起的基本操作
for sticking together these bits of code fragments,

661
00:35:33,935 --> 00:35:35,935
把这些指令组合成序列
these bits of instructions into a sequence.

662
00:35:36,890 --> 00:35:38,870
我们可以发现 从这个角度看
And you see, from this point of view,

663
00:35:40,940 --> 00:35:45,960
解释器和编译器的区别
the difference between the interpreter and the compiler, in some sense,

664
00:35:46,825 --> 00:35:49,340
是编译器有保护寄存器的标注
is that where the compiler has these preserving notes,

665
00:35:50,140 --> 00:35:52,224
上面记录着
and says, maybe I'll actually generate the

666
00:35:52,496 --> 00:35:54,220
是否需要生成保存-恢复代码
saves and restores and maybe I won't,

667
00:35:55,190 --> 00:35:57,248
而解释器会以最悲观的方式处理
the interpreter being maximally pessimistic

668
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:58,900
总是会进行保存-恢复
always has a save and restore here.

669
00:36:00,768 --> 00:36:01,930
这就是关键的区别
That's the essential difference.

670
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:06,050
为了实现这个
Well, in order to do this, of course,

671
00:36:06,650 --> 00:36:09,408
编译器需要一些理论
the compiler needs some theory of

672
00:36:09,568 --> 00:36:11,968
来确定代码序列会需要、又会修改哪些寄存器
what code sequences need and modifier registers.

673
00:36:14,260 --> 00:36:17,280
所以你放入的小片段
So the tiny little fragments that you put in, like

674
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:21,008
例如这段基础代码
the basic primitive code fragments,

675
00:36:22,740 --> 00:36:24,592
当你查找一个变量时
say, what are the operations that you do

676
00:36:24,928 --> 00:36:26,048
进行了哪些操作？
when you look up a variable?

677
00:36:26,890 --> 00:36:29,024
你又是做了些什么
What are the sequence of things that you do

678
00:36:29,056 --> 00:36:30,688
来编译一个常量
when you compile a constant

679
00:36:30,976 --> 00:36:32,100
或者应用一个函数
or apply a function?

680
00:36:32,970 --> 00:36:34,480
它们都会带有一些标注
Those have little notations in there

681
00:36:34,672 --> 00:36:36,464
说明了它们需要的和修改的寄存器
about what they need and what they modify.

682
00:36:38,780 --> 00:36:41,500
所以底层的数据结构
So the bottom-level data structures--

683
00:36:42,660 --> 00:36:44,330
我会这样讲
Well, I'll say this.

684
00:36:44,390 --> 00:36:47,910
传递给编译器的代码序列大概是这样
A code sequence to the compiler looks like this.

685
00:36:48,070 --> 00:36:51,424
它里面有实际的指令序列
It has the actual sequence of instructions.

686
00:36:55,670 --> 00:36:56,816
跟它一起的还有
And then, along with it,

687
00:36:57,184 --> 00:37:02,608
一组被修改的寄存器
there's the set of registers modified.

688
00:37:10,540 --> 00:37:12,608
还有一组需要的寄存器
And then there's the set of registers needed.

689
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,464
为了能够执行此操作
So that's the information the compiler has

690
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:26,416
编译器必须要掌握这些信息
that it draws on in order to be able to do this operation.

691
00:37:29,300 --> 00:37:31,088
它们从哪来呢
And where do those come from? Well.

692
00:37:32,910 --> 00:37:34,496
它们来自于--你们可能也想到了
Well, those come from, you might expect,

693
00:37:34,512 --> 00:37:35,536
对于那些最基本的片段
for the very primitive ones,

694
00:37:35,552 --> 00:37:36,840
我们会手工添加
we're going to put them in by hand.

695
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:38,864
然后 当我们组合两个序列时
And then, when we combine two sequences,

696
00:37:38,896 --> 00:37:41,020
我们会计算出这两个集合
we'll figure out what these things should be.

697
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:44,128
举一个非常基本的例子
So for example, a very primitive one, let's see.

698
00:37:48,430 --> 00:37:51,408
例如做一个寄存器赋值
How about doing a register assignment.

699
00:37:51,770 --> 00:37:53,504
因此 基本代码片段会说
So a primitive sequence might say,

700
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:56,220
噢 它是个代码片段
oh, it's code fragment.

701
00:37:56,225 --> 00:38:03,175
代码的指令部分是(ASSIGN R1 (FETCH R2))
Its code instruction is assigned to R1, fetch of R2.

702
00:38:03,170 --> 00:38:04,272
这个例子就是这样的
So this is an example.

703
00:38:05,425 --> 00:38:08,520
一段指令序列大概就是这样
That might be an example of a sequence of instructions.

704
00:38:08,770 --> 00:38:10,530
和它在一起的是
And along with that, it'll say, Oh

705
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:15,760
它需要记得修改了R1
oh, what I need to remember is that that modifies R1

706
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:21,168
然后它需要R2
and then it needs R2.

707
00:38:24,690 --> 00:38:26,992
因此当你开始构建编译器时
So when you're first building this compiler,

708
00:38:27,100 --> 00:38:29,350
你放入这样的一个片段
you put in little fragments of stuff like that.

709
00:38:30,950 --> 00:38:33,200
当它组合两个序列时
And now, when it combines two sequences,

710
00:38:36,704 --> 00:38:38,048
我要组合
if I'm going to combine,

711
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:41,584
代码片段S1
let's say, sequence one,

712
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:47,168
修改了一组寄存器M1
that modifies a bunch of registers M1,

713
00:38:48,450 --> 00:38:51,420
并且需要一组寄存器N1
and needs a bunch of registers N1.

714
00:38:54,850 --> 00:38:59,488
并且我要把它和序列S2组合到一起
And I'm going to combine that with sequence two.

715
00:39:00,810 --> 00:39:05,968
后者修改了一组寄存器M2
That modifies a bunch of registers M2,

716
00:39:07,110 --> 00:39:10,000
并且需要一组寄存器N2
and needs a bunch of registers N2.

717
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:14,830
这样我们就能得出结果
Then, well, we can reason it out.

718
00:39:15,110 --> 00:39:16,320
新的代码片段是这样的
The new code fragment,

719
00:39:17,184 --> 00:39:21,824
指令序列S1后面跟着S2
sequence one, and-- followed by sequence two,

720
00:39:24,090 --> 00:39:26,450
它要修改什么?
well, what's it going to modify?

721
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:29,184
它要修改的是
The things that it will modify are the things

722
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:32,688
被S1或者被S2修改的寄存器
that are modified either by sequence one or sequence two.

723
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,352
N1和N2的并集
So the union of these two

724
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:39,640
就是新的修改集
sets are what the new thing modifies.

725
00:39:40,460 --> 00:39:41,790
然后你问
And then you say, well, what is this--

726
00:39:44,660 --> 00:39:46,416
又需要哪些寄存器？
what registers is it going to need?

727
00:39:47,950 --> 00:39:49,776
需要这些寄存器的是
It's going to need the things that are,

728
00:39:49,930 --> 00:39:51,850
首先 一定是序列S1需要的
first of all, needed by sequence one.

729
00:39:52,912 --> 00:39:54,496
因此必然有N1
So what it needs is sequence one.

730
00:39:55,190 --> 00:39:58,288
然后 并不是N2里面的所有元素
And then, well, not quite all of the ones

731
00:39:58,320 --> 00:39:59,616
我们都需要
that are needed by sequence two.

732
00:39:59,750 --> 00:40:03,490
新的修改集需要N2中那些
What it needs are the ones that are needed by sequence two

733
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:06,880
没有被S1修改过的寄存器
that have not been set up by sequence one.

734
00:40:08,140 --> 00:40:09,728
所以 这个并集是N1并上
So it's sort of the union of

735
00:40:11,664 --> 00:40:13,408
序列S2的需要集N2
the things that sequence two needs

736
00:40:14,512 --> 00:40:18,528
减去序列S1的修改集M1
minus the ones that sequence one modifies.

737
00:40:19,310 --> 00:40:20,880
因为它关心的是如何设置它们
Because it worries about setting them up.

738
00:40:23,950 --> 00:40:26,260
这就是编译器的基本结构
So there's the basic structure of the compiler.

739
00:40:26,700 --> 00:40:29,824
我们进行寄存器优化的方式是
The way you do register optimizations is you

740
00:40:30,220 --> 00:40:32,704
一些策略来应对需要保护的东西
you have some strategies for what needs to be preserved.

741
00:40:34,100 --> 00:40:35,632
这取决于数据结构
That depends on a data structure.

742
00:40:35,728 --> 00:40:38,512
这取决于将东西组合在一起的操作
Well, it depends on the operation of what it means to put things together.

743
00:40:39,030 --> 00:40:41,632
想知道要保护哪些东西
Preserving something, that depends on knowing

744
00:40:41,930 --> 00:40:47,280
就需要知道这段代码需要以及修改的寄存器
what registers are needed and modified by these code fragments.

745
00:40:48,750 --> 00:40:51,260
这就需要我们有一个数据结构
That depends on having little data structures,

746
00:40:51,424 --> 00:40:55,430
它不但要存放实际的指令序列
which say, a code sequence is the actual instructions,

747
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:57,330
它修改了什么 又需要什么
what they modify and what they need.

748
00:40:57,330 --> 00:40:59,776
这些信息来自于--最基本的情况是内置的
That comes from, at the primitive level, building it in.

749
00:40:59,790 --> 00:41:01,360
对于最基本的情况
At the primitive level,

750
00:41:01,376 --> 00:41:02,528
我们可以容易地知道
it's going to be completely obvious

751
00:41:03,008 --> 00:41:04,448
需要哪些寄存器 又修改了哪些
what something needs and modifies.

752
00:41:04,820 --> 00:41:05,350
另外
Plus,

753
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:08,608
利用这个特定的方法构建复杂指令时
this particular way that says, when I build up bigger ones,

754
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:11,890
我们可以像这样生成新的修改集
here's how I generate the new set of registers modified

755
00:41:11,930 --> 00:41:13,370
以及新的需要集
and the new set of registers needed.

756
00:41:15,275 --> 00:41:17,770
这就是全部的内容 -- 我不该这么说
And that's the whole-- well, I shouldn't say that's the whole thing.

757
00:41:17,770 --> 00:41:19,344
这就是书里面大概30页的细节
That's the whole thing except for about

758
00:41:19,744 --> 00:41:21,870
的核心内容了
about 30 pages of details in the book.

759
00:41:22,310 --> 00:41:27,690
但它是一个完全可用的初级编译器
But it is a perfectly usable rudimentary compiler.

760
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:31,376
让我给你展示一下它能做什么
Let me kind of show you what it does.

761
00:41:31,392 --> 00:41:35,568
假设我们从一个递归阶乘开始
Suppose we start out with recursive factorial.

762
00:41:36,208 --> 00:41:38,608
这些幻灯片的字太小不适合阅读
And these slides are going to be much too small to read.

763
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:39,792
我只想快速翻一下代码
I just want to flash through the code

764
00:41:39,792 --> 00:41:41,280
让你们看看它有多少代码
and show you about how much it is.

765
00:41:42,250 --> 00:41:43,296
代码从这开始--
That starts out with--

766
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:45,680
这是代码的第一部分
here's a first block of it,

767
00:41:45,950 --> 00:41:47,680
这里编译了一个过程入口
where it compiles a procedure entry

768
00:41:47,696 --> 00:41:48,736
并进行了一些赋值操作
and does a bunch of assignments.

769
00:41:48,752 --> 00:41:51,488
这基本上对应了解释器中
And this thing is basically up through the part where

770
00:41:52,650 --> 00:41:53,904
进行判断之前的部分
sets up to do the predicate

771
00:41:54,310 --> 00:41:56,590
并判断谓词是否成立
and test whether the predicate's true.

772
00:41:56,970 --> 00:41:57,856
第二部分是
The second part

773
00:41:58,460 --> 00:42:03,730
递归调用N-1的阶乘的结果
is what results from-- in the recursive call to fact of n minus one.

774
00:42:04,120 --> 00:42:05,056
最后一部分是
And this last part

775
00:42:06,070 --> 00:42:07,488
从那里返回
is coming back from that

776
00:42:07,872 --> 00:42:09,900
并处理递归的基本情况
and then taking care of the constant case.

777
00:42:09,900 --> 00:42:13,168
这就是编译阶乘会生成的代码量
So that's about how much code it would produce for factorial.

778
00:42:13,720 --> 00:42:17,696
当然 我们可以把这个编译器做得更好
We could make this compiler much, much better, of course.

779
00:42:18,675 --> 00:42:21,240
优化它的主要方式是
The main way we could make it better is

780
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:24,000
当你调用一个过程时
to allow the compiler to make any assumptions at all

781
00:42:24,352 --> 00:42:26,272
允许编译器做任何假设
about what happens when you call a procedure.

782
00:42:26,970 --> 00:42:28,288
举例来说
So this compiler, for instance,

783
00:42:28,300 --> 00:42:32,320
这个编译器甚至不知道
doesn't even know, say, that multiplication

784
00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:36,140
乘法可以被内联执行
you say, is something that could be coded in line.

785
00:42:36,144 --> 00:42:37,872
它则会自行构建起整个机制
Instead, it sets up this whole mechanism.

786
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,344
进行APPLY-DISPATCH
It goes to apply-dispatch.

787
00:42:41,370 --> 00:42:42,496
这是极大的浪费
That's a tremendous waste,

788
00:42:42,544 --> 00:42:45,020
因为 每当你进行APPLY-DISPATCH时
because what you do every time you go to apply-dispatch

789
00:42:45,020 --> 00:42:46,800
你都要关心这个参数表
is you have to concern about this argument list,

790
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:49,104
因为它是个很普遍的操作
because it's a very general thing you're going to.

791
00:42:49,136 --> 00:42:51,072
在任何真实的编译器中
In any real compiler, of course,

792
00:42:51,088 --> 00:42:53,296
你会有寄存器来暂存参数
you're going to have registers for holding arguments.

793
00:42:53,770 --> 00:42:55,312
你要开始保护
And you're going to start preserving

794
00:42:56,380 --> 00:42:58,050
保存这些寄存器
saving the way you use those registers

795
00:42:58,050 --> 00:43:01,616
和这里的策略相近
similar to the same strategy here.

796
00:43:02,850 --> 00:43:05,936
因此 我们可能主要通过这个方法
So that's probably the very main way

797
00:43:05,952 --> 00:43:08,300
来优化书中这个特定的编译器
this particular compiler in the book could be fixed.

798
00:43:08,690 --> 00:43:09,700
还有其它的一些方法
There are other things like

799
00:43:09,700 --> 00:43:11,824
比如查找变量的值
looking up variable values and

800
00:43:11,830 --> 00:43:13,872
使用更高效的基本操作
making more efficient primitive operations,

801
00:43:13,888 --> 00:43:14,560
等等方法
and all sorts of things.

802
00:43:14,590 --> 00:43:16,608
本质上来说 一个好的Lisp编译器
Essentially, a good Lisp compiler

803
00:43:16,624 --> 00:43:18,496
可以吸收任意数量的努力
can absorb an arbitrary amount of effort.

804
00:43:19,720 --> 00:43:21,632
可能这其中的一个原因是
And probably one of the reasons

805
00:43:21,890 --> 00:43:23,040
跟FORTRAN这类语言相比
Lisp is slow

806
00:43:23,632 --> 00:43:25,440
Lisp就要慢一些
with compared to languages like FORTRAN

807
00:43:25,900 --> 00:43:28,192
如果你回头审视历史
is that, if you look over history

808
00:43:28,224 --> 00:43:31,120
会发现人们为构建Lisp编译器而呕心沥血
the amount of effort that's gone into building Lisp compilers,

809
00:43:31,160 --> 00:43:32,352
但也远远没有接近
it's nowhere near the amount of effort

810
00:43:32,368 --> 00:43:33,900
构建FORTRAN编译器的工作量
that's gone into FORTRAN compilers.

811
00:43:34,430 --> 00:43:35,792
在接下来的几年
And maybe that's something that will

812
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:37,680
情况可能会发生变化
that will change over the next couple of years.

813
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:38,832
好吧 就讲到这里
OK, let's break.

814
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:44,650
有问题吗
Questions?

815
00:43:48,270 --> 00:43:49,950
学生: 很早的一个课时里--
AUDIENCE: One of the very first classes--

816
00:43:49,950 --> 00:43:51,408
我不记得是课上还是课后--
I don't know if it was during class or after class-

817
00:43:51,470 --> 00:43:53,888
你向我们展示了
you showed me the, the

818
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:57,520
ADD操作有一些我们看不到的基本运算
say, addition has a primitive that we don't see,

819
00:43:57,696 --> 00:43:59,216
类似于ADD%之类的
and-percent add or something like that.

820
00:43:59,825 --> 00:44:01,650
这是因为
Is that because,

821
00:44:01,650 --> 00:44:02,608
你想把代码内联为
if you're doing inline code

822
00:44:02,608 --> 00:44:08,192
专门针对二元运算对象的运算么？
you'd want to just do it for two operators, operands?

823
00:44:08,700 --> 00:44:10,256
但如果你有更多的运算对象
But if you had more operands,

824
00:44:10,288 --> 00:44:11,472
你会做什么特殊的事情吗？
you'd want to do something special?

825
00:44:12,710 --> 00:44:16,048
教授: 你看的是Scheme的实际实现
PROFESSOR: Yeah, you're looking in the actual scheme implementation.

826
00:44:16,064 --> 00:44:17,840
其中有一个‘+’ 这是一个运算符
There's a plus, and a plus is some operator.

827
00:44:17,904 --> 00:44:20,190
如果你看‘+’的源代码
And then if you go look inside the code for plus,

828
00:44:20,336 --> 00:44:21,376
你会看到一些叫做--
you see something called--

829
00:44:21,570 --> 00:44:24,144
我记不清了--可能叫ADD%、PLUS之类的东西
I forget-- and-percent plus or something like that.

830
00:44:24,550 --> 00:44:25,792
这里所进行的
And what's going on there is

831
00:44:25,792 --> 00:44:27,920
就是你说的那种优化
is that particular kind of optimization.

832
00:44:28,470 --> 00:44:31,872
因为 广义的‘+’接受任意数量的参数
Because, see, general plus takes an arbitrary number of arguments.

833
00:44:35,020 --> 00:44:36,384
所以 广义加法
So the most general plus

834
00:44:36,760 --> 00:44:38,256
会说：如果我有一个参数表
says, oh, if I have an argument list,

835
00:44:38,288 --> 00:44:40,624
我最好将它们用CONS连接到表里
I'd better cons it up in some list

836
00:44:41,630 --> 00:44:44,144
并指出有多少个参数
and then figure out how many there were or something like that.

837
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:46,160
这样效率非常低下
That's terribly inefficient,

838
00:44:46,810 --> 00:44:49,250
因为大部分时间你在把两个数相加
especially since most of the time you're probably adding two numbers.

839
00:44:49,250 --> 00:44:51,248
你不必把整个参数表连接到一起
You don't want to really have to cons this argument list.

840
00:44:52,048 --> 00:44:53,936
所以你想做的是
So what you'd like to do is build

841
00:44:55,664 --> 00:44:57,712
构建把一堆东西相加的代码
the code for plus with a bunch of entries.

842
00:44:58,150 --> 00:45:00,176
所以它做的大部分事情是一样的
So most of what it's doing is the same.

843
00:45:00,490 --> 00:45:01,952
但这里可能有个特殊的入口
However, there might be a special entry

844
00:45:01,984 --> 00:45:03,920
如果你知道只有两个参数
that you'd go to if you knew there were only two arguments.

845
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:05,875
你会把它们放到寄存器中
And those you'll put in registers.

846
00:45:05,870 --> 00:45:06,976
它们不需要参数表
they won't be in an argument list

847
00:45:06,992 --> 00:45:07,984
你也不必用CONS连接它们
and you won't have to CONS.

848
00:45:08,675 --> 00:45:10,425
这就是这些东西工作的原理
That's how a lot of these things work.

849
00:45:12,300 --> 00:45:13,725
好吧 下课吧
OK, let's take a break.
